## Capacity by technology

Global installed power-generating capacity reached a new high in 2021 of 7.9TW, nearly double the 4TW installed 15 years ago. From 2020 to 2021, capacity grew 4.8%, the biggest increase since 2015-2016. Wind and solar grew fastest.

## Capacity by region

The Asia-Pacific’s power-generating capacity has nearly tripled in a decade and a half, while Europe and North America were the regions that have grown least since 2006.

## Generation by technology

Total global power production jumped 5.6% in 2021 as economies rebounded from the worst of the Covid-19 pandemic. Coal led the growth with an 8.5% jump from 2020-2021, however, global solar generation reached 1,000TWh for the first time, while wind neared 2,000TWh.

## Generation by region

The Asia-Pacific region led the spike in global electricity production with a 9% 2020-21 jump. Power production in Asia-Pacific markets (excluding Mainland China) is now greater than in Europe or North America & Caribbean.
