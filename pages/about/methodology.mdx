# Methodology

## Scope

This marks the 10th anniversary of Climatescope, BNEF’s annual assessment of energy transition opportunities. For the first time, the project has expanded its scope to include activity not just in clean power but in the decarbonization of the transportation and buildings sectors. Climatescope represents the collective effort of over 40 BNEF analysts who gather detailed data on 136 markets globally, including 107 emerging markets and 29 developed nations. The 136 markets surveyed by Climatescope account for nearly all global population, GDP and CO2 emissions.

## Methodology

The Climatescope 2021 methodology includes 163 indicators and sub-indicators split among three sectors and into three key topic areas that encompass each market’s previous accomplishments, current investment environment, and future opportunities for clean energy growth. Three sectors – power, transport and buildings – are scored across three main parameters:

1. **Fundamentals.** This parameter encompasses a market’s key policies, market structures and barriers to investment of deployment. This includes the fundamental structures that can help renewable power, clean transport and clean technologies for heating flourish.

2. **Opportunities.** This parameter examines a market’s potential to grow its supply of renewable power, clean transport and clean technologies for heating. Markets with certain prices or other conditions offer the best opportunities for clean growth.

3. **Experience.** This parameter takes into account a market’s achievements to date across the three sectors. Markets with greater experience deploying renewable power capacity typically offer lower risks, lower technology costs and lower costs of capital for developers. This parameter includes historical deployment of clean technologies surveyed and growth rates of investment into the sectors.

It is important to note that several key indicators that contribute to the above parameters are “levelized” against a market’s gross domestic product, population, installed capacity and generation. The methodology seeks to take into account and then discount the fact that some markets attract larger volumes of capital simply because they are bigger.

## Sectors, Parameters and Indicators

Below is a complete list of indicators used in Climatescope. These are sub-divided first by sector, then by parameter.

## Power

### Fundamentals

- NDC target coverage: rewards markets based on the number of sectors that are covered by their emissions reduction goals.
- NDC target type: rewards markets that detail their emissions reduction goals in absolute terms the most, followed by those that use emission intensity targets. Markets that propose to reduce emissions against a historic trend received the least points.
- NDC target updated: rewards markets that have updated their NDCs or submitted a new document since 2019.
- Long term strategy: rewards markets that have submitted their Long Term Strategy detailing how they will reduce emissions to the UNFCCC.
- Net-zero policy: rewards markets that have a net-zero target in force, in legislative process or under discussion.
- Power Purchase Agreements (PPA) of sufficient duration: rewards markets based on the length of PPAs that are typically awarded to renewables developers, giving more point to longer-term PPAs.
- Standardized PPAs: awards points to markets where standardized PPAs can be used by renewables developer to accelerate negotiations.
- Currency of power-purchase agreements (PPAs): awards points to markets where developers can sign PPAs that guarantee payment for power delivered in U.S. dollars or Euros.
- Retail market liberalization: awards points to markets in which the retail of electricity is open to competition and where developers can sign PPAs directly with consumers.
- Bilateral power contracts: rewards markets where commercial and industrial (C&I) customers can sign (both on- and off-site) long-term contracts for clean energy.
- Transparent grid extension plan: awards points to markets where electricity grid transmission plans can be accessed by energy sector stakeholders.
- Clear rules on interconnection: rewards markets where the rules for connecting renewables assets to the grid are clear and transparent.
- Wholesale power market: awards points to markets where electricity dispatch is done on a marginal-cost basis and where a wholesale power exchange is in place.
- Utility privatization: rewards markets where generation, transmission and/or retail of electricity is open to private sector participation. The generation segment is worth twice as many points as transmission and retail, which often remains the prerogative of public entities and is not a barrier to clean energy investment.
- Utility unbundling: rewards markets where the generation, transmission and retail segments of the electricity sector are separated.
- Concentration of generation market: rewards markets in which the electricity generation market is not concentrated.
- Independent power transmission: rewards markets in which the entity responsible for the transport of electricity is not involved in other segments of the power market.

- Purchase obligation: rewards markets where the electricity off-taker is mandated to purchase all electricity produced by renewables developers.
- Clear rules on arrival of the main grid: rewards markets with clear rules on the sanctity of private assets developed in regions where main power retailers such as state-owned utilities are not yet active. Typically, these rules involve the state or utility being required to purchase the private asset at some fair market value or the asset being granted independent power producer status within the grid. Such policies help protect privately-developed mini-grids built in parts of nations where the grid does not yet exist.
- Energy-access targets: rewards markets where an energy-access target is in place.
- Energy-access initiatives: rewards markets that prioritize the development of solar home systems, mini-grids, and grid expansion to improve energy access/rural electrification.

- Offtaker risk: rewards markets where the offtaker, public or private, is the least likely to default or delay payments to renewables developers.
- Other project development barriers: rewards markets where developing renewables projects is relatively frictionless.
- Other barriers: rewards markets where there are no other barriers (e.g. business licensing requirements) that hinder the development of decentralized energy projects or retailing off-grid products.
