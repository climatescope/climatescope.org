As of December 2020, clean generation accounted for some 16% of the 17,664 gigawatt-hours the country had consumed during the year. The Dominican Republic also has in place a net metering program, which allows retail electricity customers with rooftop solar to be compensated through credits on their bills for sending surplus generation back to the grid. As of January 2020, the total users of the Net Metering Program were 5,047, and the total capacity installed was of 135.49 megawatts compared to 93.02 megawatts and 3,554 users in 2018. By July 2021, there were 8,166 users and 200 megawatts installed."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["The annual average Dominican Republic residential power price dropped by a massive 35% in 2019 from the year prior, to $86.42 per megawatt-hour.

All three prices remained flat from 2019 to 2020. Substantial subsidies targeting the retail segment of the market have kept those prices particularly low. With the commissioning of the Punta Catalina coal-fired power plant in 2019, the government foresees the possibility of cutting back on subsidies without prices having to spike. Several delays due to corruption and Covid-19 pandemic, however, are postponing this."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The Dominican Republic had 8.32 gigawatts of installed capacity in 2020, compared to 8.27 gigawatts in 2019. Oil, diesel and coal are the main sources of electricity, accounting for 6.13 gigawatts, or approximately 73% of total capacity. Small hydro, wind, solar and biomass together account for 11%. The Dominican Republic's generation market is composed by several players, including private and state-owned companies. None of these companies are solely responsible for electricity generation. There is a spot market where generators, distributors and large end-users can buy/sell the short-term energy deficit/surplus. The distribution segment is divided into three public companies: Edeeste, Edenorte and Edesur. All state-owned companies are managed by the Corporacion Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales (CDEEE).","The Dominican Republic’s clean energy sector attracted $1.6 billion of investment over 2010-2020. Wind captured the bulk of it, $764 million, followed by solar, with $523 million. Over half the investment was recorded 2017-2018. In 2019, investment dropped to $138 million from $405 million the year prior and kept falling to $101 million in 2020."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["The Dominican Republic plans to provide universal access to electricity with programs such as the 'Unidad de Electrificacion Rural y Sub-Urbana' (UERS). However, it has not established a specific target. In 2020, the Dominican Republic’s electrification rate was 97.8% and demand for power in the country has grown briskly over a decade. Specifically, peak power demand jumped 42%, from 1,810 megawatts in 2010 to 2,576 megawatts in 2020, while average annual generation grew 20% over the same period. In May 2019, CNE authorized 12 provisional concessions for potentially 874 megawatts of capacity.","A General Electricity Law states that if a generation company decides to settle in a geographical area where there are no interconnection facilities with the electric power system, a special concession to install the interconnection line can be obtained, provided that the transmission company does not assume the corresponding investments. In this case, the form in which the transmission company will reimburse the costs incurred by the generation company will be agreed upon.","Formal barriers to developing renewables in the Dominican Republic are relatively low. An incentive regime for the development of clean energy has been in place since May 2007, consistent with the national energy plan (the Plan Energetico Nacional, or PEN). It includes an investment tax credit, external financing, tax reductions, and exemptions from taxes and import duties for industrialized goods and services. Renewable energy generators have dispatch priority and open access to transmission and distribution. However, the financial instability of the Corporacion Dominicana de Empresas Electricas Estatales (CDEEE) and the subsidizing of retail electricity prices both jeopardize project developers seeking financing. Once the utility is highly indebted, excessively bureaucratic and the electricity rates do not cover all costs, and there are some delays on PPA payments.  Lower power rates have also made it challenging for new energy technologies to thrive."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["EV sales in Dominican Republic gradually increased from only 34 cars in 2017 to 438 in 2020 including hybrids.

While this market is on the way up, gasoline is the most affected by tax levels, with taz at 36%. In order to incentivize the importing of non-conventional energy vehicles, the Dominican Republic allows electric vehicles to enter the country by paying only 50% of the usual tariff, 50% of VAT and 50% for the First Plate rates.

In addition, another target is that electric motorcycles registered from the private sector represent 5% of the national fleet by 2030. It also expects to implement 14,000 EV charges by 2030.
