For 2030, the country raised the ambition for renewable electricity, aiming for a 70% share.","Greece is in the process of expanding the policy framework to double the share of renewables in electricity generation over the next decade. Increasing interconnection of the country’s island systems can offer growing opportunities for renewables deployment. Greece procures renewables capacity through an auction program that awards a feed-in premium. Since the program was launched in 2018, more than 3.5 gigawatts of wind and solar projects have been awarded.

(PPC), the former state monopoly that owns the country’s lignite and hydro assets. As part of Greece’s bailout deal with its European creditors, PPC was to sell off 40% of its lignite capacity, but no buyers were found. In September 2019, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced Greece would phase out all lignite production by 2028.","However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, PCC planned to increase lignite production to ensure adequate energy supply fearing potential Russian gas shortages. The response includes ramping up production in all Greece’s operating lignite plants. In addition, a new 660MW lignite power plant will start production in the fall of 2022. It was originally expected to operate on natural gas by 2025. Three new combined-cycle gas turbine plants of around 800 megawatts each are in the pipeline to ensure security of supply.","The transmission system operator is working to extend the grid to the islands, which host some of the best wind and solar sites, with capacity factors for the former reaching 30% in select locations. But highly seasonal power demand on the islands means that development of these sites makes economic sense only if the power can be transported to the mainland. An interconnection between the Peloponnese mainland region and Greece’s largest island, Crete, was commissioned in May 2021.
