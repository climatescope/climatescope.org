Solar capacity has grown by 21% since 2015 to over 640MW in 2019.

Honduras is a net importer in the regional market.","From 2010-2019, Honduras attracted $2.7 billion in new clean energy investment, driven by $1.3 billion for solar from 2014-2019. These investments were boosted by a feed-in premium for renewables that came into force in August 2013. PV projects up to 300MW installed by July 31, 2015 were eligible to receive a base price for their energy equal to the short-term marginal cost plus $0.03/kWh plus 10%.
