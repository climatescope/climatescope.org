In 2017, President Moon Jae-in came to power and sought a more fundamental shift in Korea’s energy policy by supporting renewables and gas at the expense of coal and nuclear. In 2022, President Yoon Suk-yeol redirected Korea’s energy policy in favor of nuclear.","In August 2022, the Yoon administration released a draft of the 10th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand. According to the plan, the share of nuclear generation will rise to 33% by 2030 from 29% in 2021. The share of renewables will also increase to 22% by 2030 from just 7% in 2021. In contrast, the share of coal and gas will fall to 42% in 2030 from 62% in 2021, in accordance with Korea’s 2030 emissions reduction goal. The Korean government aims to finalize the plan by the end of 2022.","Despite moves toward a cleaner power mix, electricity generation in South Korea is currently dominated by coal (36%), which is followed by nuclear power (29%) and gas generators (26%), with renewables contributing only 7% in 2021. The government aims to increase the share of renewables to 22% by 2030.","Renewable portfolio standards (RPS), introduced in 2012 to replace the feed-in tariff program, are the primary driver of renewables installations in Korea. RPS mandates large-scale power generators to procure a government-set percentage of electricity from renewable sources. The annual RPS mandate rose to 12.5% in 2022 from 9% in 2021.

On the generation side, coal remains the cheapest source of power generation with the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranging between $55-66/MWh in 2021. The cost of building solar and wind projects in Korea is among the highest globally with LCOEs ranging between $79-148/MWh for solar and $81-152/MWh for wind.

Korea Energy Agency issues 1 REC per every 1 MWh of electricity generated from renewable sources, taking into account the government-assigned REC multipliers by renewable technology. Large-scale utilities purchase RECs to meet their annual RPS requirement set by the government. The requirement obligates utilities to procure a set share of their total generation from renewable sources: 7% (2020), 9% (2021), 12.5% (2022).

As more Korean companies commit to using clean electricity, for example by joining the RE100 initiative, corporate demand for renewable energy is also set to rise.","Opposition from local communities is one of the biggest barriers to developing power generation projects in Korea. Local communities including residents, farmers, fisheries and environmental groups often oppose power plant development, which may cause severe delays in permitting and even cancellation of projects.
