In 2017, President Moon Jae-in came to power and sought a more fundamental shift in Korea’s energy policy by supporting renewables and gas at the expense of coal and nuclear.","Through the country’s Eighth Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, launched in December 2017, President Moon officially scrapped plans for a number of new nuclear and coal-fired power plants and signaled strong support for gas generation and renewable energy. In July 2020, the Moon administration announced the Korean New Deal, a $133 billion post-coronavirus spending package designed to accelerate the country’s energy transition and digitalize its social infrastructure. The latest 9th Basic Plan for Electricity Supply and Demand, launched in December 2020, aims to increase renewable energy capacity to 77.8 gigawatts by 2034 from 20.1 gigawatts in 2020. The plan also aims to reduce coal-fired power capacity to 29 gigawatts by 2034 from 35.8 gigawatts in 2020.","Despite moves toward a cleaner power mix, electricity generation in South Korea is currently dominated by coal (36%), which is followed by nuclear power (29%) and gas generators (26%), with renewables contributing only 7% in 2020. The government aims to increase the share of renewables to 20% by 2030.","Renewable portfolio standards (RPS), introduced in 2012 to replace the feed-in tariff program, is the primary driver of renewables installations in Korea. The country also has an emissions trading scheme that was launched in 2015."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Korea has government-regulated fixed retail electricity rates. In 2020, retail electricity customers paid an average of 9.5 U.S. cents (110 won)/kWh. On the generation side, coal remains the cheapest source of power generation with the levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) ranging between $59-71/MWh in 2020. The cost of building solar and wind projects in Korea is among the highest globally with LCOEs ranging between $73-146/MWh for solar and $78-142/MWh for wind. Market price distortion from subsidy (i.e. RPS), mountainous geography, and smaller average project size all contribute to Korea’s high cost of renewable energy."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The wholesale power market operates on a day-ahead, cost-based pool, in which the hourly price of electricity is determined by the variable cost of the marginal power plant. While the wholesale market is open to competition, Korea Electric Power Corp. monopolizes grid operation and retail market.","Renewable energy power plants receive revenue from the sale of electricity on the wholesale power market as well as through the sale of renewable energy certificates. Korea Energy Agency issues 1 REC per every 1 MWh of electricity generated from renewable sources, taking into account the government-assigned REC multipliers by renewable technology. Large-scale utilities purchase RECs to meet their annual RPS requirement set by the government. The requirement obligates utilities to procure a set share of their total generation from renewable sources: 7% (2020), 9% (2021), 10% (2022). The government plans to raise the annual mandate to 25% by 2030."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Driven by energy-intensive manufacturing sectors such as steel making, automotive and electronics, South Korea’s electricity demand will likely rise until mid-2030s, opening up opportunities to add new power generation capacity. Demand for renewable energy will continue to increase as the government aims to achieve 20% renewable generation by 2030 from just 7% in 2020.","To support Korean companies’ decarbonization efforts, the government also launched various procurement mechanisms of renewable energy in 2021, including third party power purchase agreement (PPA), renewable energy certificates (REC), green tariff, and direct investment in renewable energy. As more Korean companies commit to using clean electricity, for example by joining the RE100 initiative, the corporate demand for renewable energy is also set to rise.","Opposition from local communities is one of the biggest barriers to developing power generation projects in Korea. Local communities including residents, farmers, fisheries and environmental groups often oppose power plant development, which may cause severe delays in permitting and even cancellation of projects. To address this, the government is making efforts to streamline the permitting processes and provide clearer compensation guidelines for local communities, but these measures are unlikely to fully resolve the complex challenges around local community engagement."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Under President Moon, Korea has accelerated support for electric vehicles (EV) and fuel cell vehicles (FCV) across all modes, while Korea’s leading automaker, Hyundai Motor Group, has also increased investment in EVs and FCVs."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["The Moon administration has set aggressive short-term targets for EV and FCV deployment supported by purchase subsidies: the 2020 Green Mobility package aims to get 1.13 million electric vehicles on Korea’s roads supported by 45,000 charging stations (15,000 fast chargers) by 2025.
