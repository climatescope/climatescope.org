A new support program (Metar) was introduced in 2017, allowing new renewable projects of 0.5-1 megawatt to receive a feed-in premium and sell on the wholesale market. Projects between 50kW and 0.5MW are still eligible for the KAT feed-in tariff, but PV applications for this category ended in May 2018.","Wind power is not eligible for the Metar feed-in premium, and restrictions on building locations make support for wind very unlikely, although it is officially allowed to participate in tenders.","The government has also introduced net metering for plants below 40kW","Hungary reached 10% renewable electricity consumption in 2019, just short of its 2020 target of 11% renewable electricity.

Over 90% of households are on government-regulated tariffs.","Tariffs fell substantially in 2013 when the government imposed a 20% reduction in regulated residential electricity prices at the expense of power companies. Prices are still below cost, forcing utilities to cover the difference. The European Commission has repeatedly asked the government to enforce fully the energy directives and to adjust tariffs to reflect costs. For instance, in July 2018, the EC took Hungary to court over the exclusion of certain costs in electricity tariffs.","Wholesale electricity prices in Hungary are slightly above the average European level, at around 50 euros per MWh in 2019. In 2020, as demand dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic, prices dropped to around 39 euros/MWh.

Renewables, mainly biomass and wind, deliver the rest. Hungary is highly dependent on energy imports, mainly from Russia – a trend that the EU wants to limit. As a result, the European Commission gave approval for two new nuclear reactors at the Paks site, with a total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts, potentially limiting the opportunity for renewables.","Solar PV is expected to continue its recent growth supported by the Metar tenders, as Hungary aims to increase its share of renewable electricity from 10% in 2019 to 21% in 2030. An increasing amount of electricity is traded according to market principles, and the volume of electricity sold on the wholesale market grew sevenfold from 2019 to 2020.","Both generation and retail markets are highly concentrated.
