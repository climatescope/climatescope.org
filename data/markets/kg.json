The policy calls for the construction of 11 additional small hydro projects with a capacity of 161MW by 2021 and for renewable generation to make up 10% of Kyrgyzstan's power mix - although it does not specify which other technologies are available. The law is also expected to create incentives for the design, construction and operation of renewables projects, such as exemptions on import duties, expedited or removal of licensing processes, purchasing obligations from the state utility JSC National Grid and preferential feed-in tariffs at a 1.3 co-efficient. This law would grant renewable energy projects nondiscriminatory dispatch priority to the grid, although project owners would be responsible for paying transmission costs to interconnect to the grid. With no more specifics offered (including price), it is likely that the feed-in tariff would just extend to hydro projects and would only be granted to projects built by 2021, when the program is expected to end. As no new clean energy projects, hydro or otherwise, have been built, the status of this policy is uncertain."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Outlined in its \"Unity, Trust, Creation\" strategy, published in 2018, Kyrgyzstan will roll out a medium-term tariff plan (MTTP) for 2018-23 that will gradually increase tariff prices, making them flexible and based on the time and period of consumption by the consumer. These increases are intended to improve the financial viability of the state-owned distribution and transmission companies, which suffer weak returns due to high electricity losses and periodic blackouts. Under this MTTP, electricity tariffs are not expected to increase again until 2022, and to date, no time-based tariffs are available."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Kyrgyzstan's power sector was privatized in 1999, disbanding the state energy company Kyrgyzenergo and unbundling generation, transmission and distribution. JSC Electric Power Plants oversees generation and owns and operates nearly all of the country's existing power generation, which is mostly hydro and has not increased in recent years. No private players have entered the country's generation market, although it is technically privatized. JSC National Grid operates the transmission grid and is entirely independent of JSC Electric Power Plants. SeverElectro, VostokElectro, OshElectro and Jalal-AbadElectro are the four public distribution companies. There are also 21 private companies that operate portions of the distribution network around the country's capital, Bishkek. While the energy market is technically unbundled, government dominance leaves very little movement for private players."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Despite an aging power fleet and transmission and distribution grid, almost 100% of Kyrgyzstan's population has access to electricity and the country has not established any energy access targets. That is partly why the country has invested little in upgrading infrastructure or diversifying its power mix, and has allocated minimal to no resources into grid expansion, mini-grids or solar home systems. A government program in 2018 to install PV systems in remote villages is the only residential solar initiative to date in the country, indicating there is little support for such technology at the government level."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Kyrgyzstan's electric vehicle market is still very primitive, with only several hundred vehicles imported into the country and no domestic manufacturing to date (although the first manufacturing facility is currently being built in the city of Balykchy).
