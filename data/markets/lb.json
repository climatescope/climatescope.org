An update in 2019 set a target for 30% of final energy consumption to come from renewables by 2030. Lebanon’s National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP), which was released in 2016, provided a roadmap for how to achieve the 2020 and 2030 goals. However, the country largely missed its 2020 target as vested interests in the fossil fuel industry and financial crisis have made it difficult to make progress without foreign intervention. The next iteration of the NREAP will be released this year for the 2021-25 period.","Only one power purchase agreement (PPA) has been signed to date in Lebanon – a 20-year contract for the 226 megawatt (MW) Akkar Wind Farm. The auction for the farm was launched in 2013, but the PPA was only signed in 2018, and the project has yet to reach financial close or the start of construction. There are three more renewable energy auctions pending at varying stages: four wind farms (each 50-100MW) totaling 260-520MW launched in 2018; 12 solar PV plants (each 10-15MW) totaling 120-180MW launched in 2017; and three solar PV-plus-storage plants (PV: 100MW each and storage: 70MWh each) totaling 300MW launched in 2018."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Lebanon’s national utility, Electricite du Liban (EDL), has a monopoly on transmission and distribution to end-users but has not adjusted tariffs in several years.
