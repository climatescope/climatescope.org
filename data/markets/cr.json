To put that latter goal in context, in 2020, 99.8% of Costa Rica’s generation came from clean sources, including large hydro. Hydropower is the country’s predominant source of capacity, at 2,330 megawatts, and accounted for 71% of 2020 generation. More geothermal capacity was added in 2019 than any other technology, with 50 megawatts brought online. Geothermal in 2020 accounts for 7% of Costa Rica’s total capacity.","Costa Rica does not need an auction policy since there is an oversupply of renewable energy, however, it was one of the first countries in Latin America to implement a net metering program. The producer-consumer may deposit the unconsumed energy in the distribution network and will have the right to withdraw up to a maximum of 49% of the total energy generated, to use it in the following months in an annual period.

However, the Costa Rican market allows private participation in the form of cooperatives and independent power producers. These entities can be involved with generation and distribution in some parts of the country, but in 2019, ICE and CNFL (its subsidiary) were responsible for generating 67% of total electricity produced.","Costa Rica attracted $2.1 billion in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-2019. Over a third of that capital was directed to small hydro plants ($0.8 billion), followed by geothermal with $0.6 billion and wind with $0.6 billion. Investment peaked in 2014, with almost $0.6 billion accounting for these three technologies. But this dropped by half in 2017 and was even smaller in the next years.

However, high hydro penetration and slow demand growth have curtailed opportunities for new entrants. With typically around 70% of the country’s power coming from hydro, the need to add other clean generation to achieve the national 100% renewable energy goal is limited.","In 2010, the country established an import-tax exemption for equipment and materials brought in to support renewable energy development. Law 51, which came in force in 2016, authorized power purchase agreements (PPA) for up to 20 years. However, private companies that develop renewable energy projects are not allowed to build power plants of over 50 megawatts, limiting the competition between private and public projects. In addition, due to the low demand caused by the pandemic, ICE is not renewing contracts to buy power generated from other players, once the power it generated is already sufficient to supply electricity to all.
