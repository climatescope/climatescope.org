Until 2017, Finland offered a feed-in premium for wind and various bioenergy technologies.","The government submitted a bill in October 2018 to ban the use of coal for energy, with a draft deadline of May 2029 for most plants. It has agreed a 90 million euro ($101 million) investment support scheme for plants that switch away from coal before 2025. Domestically mined peat generation – which has similar carbon emissions as lignite – will, however, be slowly phased out only in the 2030s.

The CHP plants are mainly fueled by biomass and waste, with coal and peat making up a smaller share of the fuel mix. These plants supply Finland’s many district heating networks, as well as the power system. The share of wind generation has grown rapidly, from around 3% in 2015 to 12% in 2020.","Around 1 gigawatt (GW) of subsidy-free wind farms are either in the pipeline or newly commissioned, as 14 corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed between 2015 and mid-2021. Utility-scale solar has not taken off, but distributed solar capacity reached 290 megawatts (MW) in 2020.

However, increased use of biofuels could also help achieve the country’s renewable energy in transport target.","Finland’s tax regime favors low-emission vehicles, as the purchase tax is determined by the CO2-intensity of the vehicle. The purchase tax is charged in addition to value added tax and can be as high as 30% of the purchase price for cars with emissions over 200 grams of CO2 per kilometer. That compares to just 2.7% for BEVs.","There are also subsidies on offer to encourage EV adoption and the installation of chargers. Between 2018 and 2021, private individuals can benefit from a grant of 2,000 euros when buying a fully electric car. Meanwhile, housing associations managing multi-family buildings can receive support for 35% of the installation cost for EV chargers, up to a maximum of 90,000 euros.
