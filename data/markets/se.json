Since 2020, the country has been coal-free in power generation. Policymakers avoid setting technology targets, out of a preference for market mechanisms that allow the cheapest technologies to prevail. A key challenge for reducing emissions in Sweden are the large district heating facilities that currently burn a mixture of waste, biomass, and occasionally oil and gas. That said, Sweden’s power sector is one of the cleanest in the European Union."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Sweden has some of the lowest wholesale power prices in the EU. Yet, once taxes and surcharges are added, Swedish retail electricity prices rise, bringing the country to the middle of the EU pack. About one-third of Swedish electricity retail prices are accounted for by energy cost, with the remainder made up of taxes, such as VAT and an energy tax, as well as grid-use charges. There are no bans on differentiated tariffs, such as time-of-use rates."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Sweden’s power system is fully liberalized and in line with EU standards. The country has a competitive power market, as well as an open retail market. Any licensed company is allowed to own generation assets or to sell electricity to consumers. Companies are also permitted to sign power purchase agreements directly with power producers or utilities. The power system is dominated by hydro and nuclear capacity. Combined, these two technologies account for half of the country’s 2020 installed capacity, contributing to about 75% of generation. The country also has a large onshore wind fleet. Sweden’s electricity generation from burning fuels like waste also supplies the country’s district heating facilities. On very cold days, these combined heat and power plants usually supplement their fuel supply with oil to achieve a higher thermal output."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Similar to many other EU countries, Sweden is struggling with the permitting process for renewables, particularly onshore wind.

Sweden also penalizes the purchase of high-emission vehicles, by way of a tax on the first three years of ownership."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["Sweden’s decarbonization philosophy is centered around achieving CO2 targets, rather than favoring specific technologies. Consequently, there is no policy explicitly in favor of electric vehicles. Instead, the country’s 70% emissions reduction target in transport by 2030, combined with a series of other mechanisms, work in favor of decarbonizing the vehicle fleet in the cheapest way possible. Incentives are open to all vehicles that meet the low- or zero-emission criteria, which in some cases includes cars that run on biofuels. The only outright support for EVs that Sweden has in place is a scheme to support charging infrastructure, which ended in 2020.
