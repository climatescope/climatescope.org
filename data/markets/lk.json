Rooftop solar is a bright spark in the renewable energy sector. Rooftop solar connections rose 26% to 275 megawatts in 2020 from 217 megawatts a year earlier. The availability of a net metering scheme coupled with high tariffs have incentivized growth in solar installation capacity. Imports of equipment for renewable energy including solar panels and storage batteries, for example, are exempt from the national building tax (NBT), as well as the ports and airport levy (PAL).","The country hasn’t implemented any battery storage into the grid system but has an ambitious goal. Sri Lanka's grid is isolated – it has yet to establish connections with any of its neighbors – which also impacts future planning.","Off-grid generation is available in some locations, usually due to the unavailability of the national grid or as a matter of policy.
