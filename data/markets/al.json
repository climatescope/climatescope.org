All PAAs in Albania have a 15-year duration.","The country’s power policy is centered around renewable energy additions to the grid, as well as improving the overall grid. Albania has proven to be successful in this objective. The country sources most of its energy from renewable sources, mainly hydro, so a big challenge is bridging the remaining gap and keeping a stable grid because of the prevalence of renewables.

The competitive side of the wholesale market comprises independent producers, with some large customers receiving power via bilateral contracts.","while Albania has a 100% electrification rate, residential and commercial photovoltaics on rooftops have been increasing in recent years. Albania’s net metering policy applies to all households producing a maximum of 500 kilowatts. This was implemented to incentivize rooftop solar integration. Retail licenses are possible for those who wish to sell the electricity that they are generating."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["OSHEE, the distribution system operator and supplier of electricity for regulated tariff customers, will act as the offtaker for new renewable projects. It is currently undergoing reform, using a loan from the World Bank to reduce its debt burden. This debt has accumulated as a result of low tariffs, electricity theft, and technical losses in the distribution system. OSHEE's perilous financial position means there is higher offtaker risk and any PPA will most likely be signed in conjunction with one, or several, government or World Bank guarantees. There is very little availability of data and transparency from the government, which creates a significant barrier to renewable energy growth in the country.","Albania has a very antiquated transmission system and some plants that are in need of modernization.
