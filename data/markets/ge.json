There are both conditional and unconditional targets set for the country. Georgia will reduce emissions 35% from 1990 levels unconditionally. With the right international support it will reduce emissions 50-57% of 1990 levels. All sectors are included apart from land use, which is still being audited. Firewood use in particular is tricky to measure, since deforestation to use fuel for heating is widespread in rural areas.

However, with most retail rates set by the Tariff Commission, prices are still regulated. In early 2022, prices went up by 90% for business consumers but only 10% for residential customers.

A key barrier to further decarbonization remains the speed of government action, and the ability to get public buy-in for projects. The most recent story on most energy sector observers’ minds is the cancellation of the Namakhvani dam. The 430MW project planned by the Turkish company Enka would have been the largest one built by the country after the separation from the Soviet Union, and alleviated the strain on grid supply. However, faced with strong protests by locals, the project was finally canceled. Rumors about the government agreeing to pay the contractor more than they should for the project, as well as the widespread sense that the dam would not benefit locals played a part in building public sentiment against the project. Responses on the cancellation are mixed; there is widespread agreement that the country needs more investment in its energy infrastructure, but balancing the various interests of local and national entities is not easy. The event also highlights the challenge for international investors in Georgia: even if the national government is a willing and supportive partner, local entities need to be brought on board as well, and the national government may be limited in its ability to push for support."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Georgia currently has a small domestic market for electric vehicles.
