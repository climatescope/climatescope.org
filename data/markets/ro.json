In June 2018, Romania’s parliament approved the introduction of a net-metering scheme for small-scale renewables up to 100kW, which allows individuals to deduct the power they produce from their electricity bill. Residential solar is also supported through the “Casa Verde” grant program that finally kicked off in September 2020 following administrative delays. For utility-scale projects, Romania adopted regulations allowing corporate power purchase agreements for projects built after June 2020. Romania launched a tender in March 2022, for wind and solar projects, with a total budget of €458 millionand capacity of 950MW.","The declining economics of Romanian coal plants was likely a deciding factor when setting the 2030 phase-out target. The carbon price under the European Emissions Trading Scheme has become a heavy financial burden for Romania’s main lignite power producer, CE Oltenia.

Industrial, commercial and residential prices grew at an average of 13% whereas wholesale prices plummeted 47% to $85.31 in 2021.

Enel, which in 2015 also considered exiting the Romanian market, has announced that it will instead sell off minority stakes in its Romanian subsidiaries.","Romania caps electricity prices (extended until March 2023). Households with monthly consumption of under 500kWh receive a subsidy besides the price cap. The scheme has been expanded for almost all non-household consumers (except large electricity consumers who have benefited from Ordinance 81 on a state aid scheme approved by the European Commission).
