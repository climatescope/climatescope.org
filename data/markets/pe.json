Since then, four auctions have been held, resulting in 71 project developments totaling 1.34 gigawatts of biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. But this program has been suspended. Peru offers priority dispatch to clean energy plants and 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects.","Peru held an auction for off-grid solar in November 2014 to contract as much as 500,000 off-grid PV systems. Ergon, the only winner, said it will develop 150,000 to 200,000 systems by 2034, when the investment contract expires. As of July 2019, Ergon had commissioned almost 134,000 systems. Peru was among the first countries to hold off-grid energy auctions.","The Ministry of Energy and Mines published in 2015 Decree 1221, aiming to improve the regulation of electricity distribution and promote access to electricity in Peru. However, it took until 2018 for the Decreto Supremo del Reglamento de la Generacion Distribuida to be published for public comments.

In recent years, clean energy investment in the country has faded, dropping to $300 million in 2017 and less than $2 million in 2018. The country has received capital from international and national commercial financial institutions, as well as development banks. The biggest lead arrangers are U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corp.

There are indications the country is oversupplied with power assets, which would be the main explanation for the hiatus in renewable auctions.","Aside from accelerated depreciation, Peru offers no tax incentives for clean energy, charging 18% of import taxes for common renewable equipment such as wind turbines and PV panels, and it collects a value added tax averaging 16%."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["The government has yet to implement any substantive policy support in this sector and the EV market remains at an early stage."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["The government has yet to implement any substantive policy support in this sector and the EV market remains at an early stage."]},{"key":3,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Some of the most important challenges include: Not having a legal framework for EVs, including regulations covering charging stations and their interaction with the power national grid.
