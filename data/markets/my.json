The country achieved 100% electrification in 2015. The long-term economic growth prospects of the country offer further potential for power demand growth, and the government aims to ramp up solar power capacity to meet this demand at least partially. The country has a potential for 42GW of rooftop solar power capacity, and 16.5GW of solar on water bodies. Malaysia is also the third-largest PV cell producer in the world. The average age of power generation assets in the country is still low, therefore Malaysia does not have a program to modernize power plants.","The electricity sector is partially unbundled, with private participation allowed in electricity generation. Independent power producers account for about 70% of all power generation assets in Malaysia. The three state-owned utilities – TNB, Serawak Energy and Sabah Electricity – are the only entities allowed to participate in electricity transmission and distribution."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Malaysia passed the Renewable Energy Act in June 2011 and followed it up with the Renewable Energy (Feed-in Approval and Feed-in Tariff Rate) Rules in the same year.

In 2016, the government announced rules for auctions of large-scale solar power projects (greater than 30MW capacity). The country has conducted four rounds of solar PV capacity auctions until 2020 and has awarded 2.3GW of new projects since 2016 through this route.","In 2018, the Malaysian government announced that it targets 20% of the country’s electricity generation from renewable energy sources by 2025.

Average power prices have remained the same across all segments for the last five years. However, Malaysia also has a cost pass through mechanism that adjusts electricity bills for variations in fuel prices.","Foreign investors are not allowed to have majority shareholding in renewable energy assets in the country. This forces foreign companies to tie up with local partners to participate in auctions and other feed-in tariff projects. Additionally, feed-in tariff projects are incentivized to use locally sourced equipment by providing bonus tariffs. Land for large-scale projects is a growing constraint, as much of the available acreage is high-value agricultural land. The average electricity tariff for residential consumers is significantly lower than that for commercial and industrial consumers.
