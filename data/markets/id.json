Such sources, however, also include technologies like nuclear, hydrogen, coal bed methane, gasified coal, and liquefied coal. Nevertheless, this target is ambitious, given the low levels of finance committed to renewables in the recent past. Indonesia’s existing renewable energy capacity is comprised mostly of geothermal and hydro plants. Solar and wind accounted for less than 1% of installed capacity as of 2020.","A draft of the 2021 electricity supply plan (RUPTL) shared in May 2021 suggests the Indonesian government is gradually shifting its focus away from coal and toward renewables. The plan cut 50% of coal and 40% of gas power capacity additions proposed under the previous plan. The draft also raised the solar target to 6 gigawatts of new capacity by 2030, up from 907 megawatts in the 2019 plan.

The availability of cheap, domestic coal resources made it the technology of choice for new capacity additions over the last decade."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Renewable energy development is hindered by a challenging regulatory environment. The current framework requires that new solar and wind projects be awarded through a limited tender process with a minimum of two bidders. Under this process, only pre-qualified bidders included in the ‘list of selected providers’ (locally known as the Daftar Penyedia Terseleksi, or DPT) are invited to participate. It is unclear if all pre-selected bidders are invited to participate. The frequency of when a pre-qualification round will be issued is also unclear, creating additional uncertainties.","Renewable energy tariffs are restricted to 85% of the regional generation cost if it exceeds the national average. If the regional cost is less than the national average, tariffs can be negotiated between PLN and the developer. This forces renewables to compete with subsidized coal generation. The process to participate in the tender is not clear, and there is little clarity on the template of the power purchase agreement. These policies have increased risks and have rendered renewable energy projects less attractive to investors.","Over the last year, the government made several changes benefiting renewable energy developments such as awarding all RE projects with “must-run” status. The government also lifted foreign ownership restrictions on power projects above 1 megawatt. A presidential regulation on renewable energy is reportedly under consideration by the government to spur development. Discussions on additional incentives include the re-introduction of a feed-in tariff scheme. As of August 2021, the regulation is not yet finalized.","Consistently overly optimistic demand projections under previous RUPTLs resulted in a substantial over-build of new coal-fired power plants. This resulted in an overcapacity issue, with reserve margins exceeding 30% on many of its power grids.
