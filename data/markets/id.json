Solar and wind accounted for less than 1% of installed capacity as of 2021.","The 2021 electricity supply plan (RUPTL) indicates a gradual shift from coal toward renewables. The plan cut 50% of coal and 40% of gas power capacity additions proposed under the previous plan.

It is unclear if all pre-selected bidders are invited to participate.

If the regional cost is less than the national average, tariffs can be negotiated between PLN and the developer. This forces renewables to compete with subsidized coal generation. The process to participate in the tender is not clear, and there is little clarity on the template of the power purchase agreement. These policies have increased risks and have rendered renewable energy projects less attractive to investors.","Over the last year, the government made several changes benefiting renewable energy developments such as awarding all RE projects with “must-run” status. The government also lifted foreign ownership restrictions on power projects above 1 megawatt.","On September 15, 2022, Indonesia issued the long-awaited presidential regulation on the acceleration of the development of renewable energy for electricity supply (Perpres 112 of 2022). The regulation called for the formulation of a roadmap to accelerate coal plant retirement, and introduced revised benchmark ceiling price incentives for renewables.","Consistently overly optimistic demand projections under previous RUPTLs resulted in a substantial overbuild of new coal-fired power plants.
