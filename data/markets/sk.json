The country’s first technology-neutral large scale renewable energy auction was launched in February 2020 but cancelled on April 1 due to Covid-19.

The country is part of the 'Central' area, which includes Hungary, Poland, and the Czech Republic. Wholesale and industrial electricity prices in Slovakia rose in 2016 for the first time since 2011, along with the EU average. While wholesale price decreased in 2020, industrial prices kept rising. The driver was upward pressure from gas prices, which increased as a result of rising demand from cold weather and reduced nuclear capacity in the region.

The largest producer is Slovenske Elektrarne (Enel), operating two nuclear, two coal-fired, 31 hydroelectric and two photovoltaic power plants, generating over 70% of the country’s total electricity production.  In 2017, retirement of 1.61GW of large hydro and oil capacity caused a 2.5% drop in generating capacity in 2018. Growth recovered in 2020, with capacity 5% higher than two years before.","The government aims to reduce import dependence. However, its main tool to achieve that is through an 880MW extension of the Mochovce nuclear power plant – an extension that was started in 1985 but has been subject to several delays. At the end of 2020, the project secured a promise of loans from Italy and Czech companies. The government has also sought to improve power market integration, with short-term trading with the Czech Republic and Hungary starting in 2012, and the day-ahead market coupled with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, opening in late 2014.

The sale of Enel's remaining 33% stake for the same amount will happen once it completes its Mochove nuclear plant, that has faced delays and cost increases, leading to pressure from the Slovakian government.","Investment in Slovakia's clean energy sector has been limited by administrative barriers, policy uncertainty, and the focus on nuclear expansion. As an example, Slovakia has no utility-scale wind farms. In 2009, investors were unable to obtain permission for projects above 10kW from the grid operator (SEPS) which considers wind unstable and prone to price fluctuations. Meanwhile, smaller turbines are hindered by regulation and legislation, including that for protected bird sites covering 23% of the country.
