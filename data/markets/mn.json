These conditions can adversely affect the performance of EV batteries. The weather also limits the capacity for charging infrastructure: while it would normally take 15 minutes to charge with a direct-current fast charger, this could take two hours in Mongolia’s harsh cold. Additionally, the geography of Mongolia results in few inhabited areas along hundreds of kilometers of roads from one city to the next. This creates difficulties in building grid to support a lone charger in a desolate area. Lastly, the typical Mongol purchases an imported car that is usually more than 10 years old from Japan due to their lower purchasing power.
