Wind projects attracted $85 million of investment in 2019.","El Salvador’s renewables boom is set to continue with more project completions in the next two years. Still, the country remains highly dependent on fossil fuels and hydro, exposing the power market to price spikes during droughts and periods of high oil prices. Investment in renewables is seen as a path to reducing these impacts.","El Salvador has seen little economic growth since 2000, and its government is deeply indebted. Power demand has fallen from 1,093MW in 2016 to 1,010MW in 2020. High crime levels add to the cost of doing business.
