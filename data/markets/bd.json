This would require about 3.1GW of installed capacity. Even so, the development of renewables in the country has been slow and given the pace of development, it is unlikely that the country will meet its goal.","Distributed solar systems lead the development of renewables in the country. The government extends support to rooftop solar through its net metering policy which was introduced in 2018. For commercial and industrial customers, the option of third-party PPA is not available as the utility does not permit the usage of its infrastructure to wheel third party power. Hence, rooftop solar is the sole option.","More recently, federal organizations like the Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) have been conducting utility-scale auctions.","Investments in the renewable energy sector have mostly come from international development finance institutions such as the Asian Development Bank. Financing of projects by commercial banks is constrained by unfavorable terms such as high interest rates or short tenors."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["The Bangladesh Power Development Board (BPDB) is the bulk buyer of electricity and dominates the power distribution business.

Participation of private players is only allowed in the generation business. In September 2021, more than 40% of the installed capacity was set up by independent power producers. Distribution business is controlled by government-owned utilities.","Bangladesh’s installed capacity has historically been dominated by natural gas power plants. These power plants make up more than half of Bangladesh’s total installed capacity. However, the country’s natural gas reserves have been depleting. As an alternative, the government had plans to significantly raise its coal capacity. Due to the rising pressure to reduce dependence on dirty fuels, it scrapped several coal projects in 2021.","Bangladesh is running two types of rural electrification programs for extension of the conventional grid to remote areas and installation of solar irrigation pumps, solar minigrids and improved cookstoves. Apart from these, the government-backed NBFC, the Infrastructure Development Company (IDCOL), started a Solar Home System program in 2003 to supply electricity in areas where grid access is challenging. It is also running a solar mini-grid program to install renewables where grid expansion is tricky. As on July 2021, the country had a national electrification rate of 99%."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["The slow progress of renewables is due to a number of factors including a lack of a well-defined regulatory framework, availability of land, and access to commercial financing.

Although there is no official exemption in place, EVs enjoy lower taxation. This is because the Bangladesh Road Transport Authority (BRTA) cannot impose Advance Income Tax (AIT) on EVs due to absence of the required provision in the finance act.","Bangladesh set comprehensive emission standards for the first time in 2005.

They are powered by lead acid batteries. These vehicles do not require registration, although their rising fleet numbers may nudge the government to bring them under formal rules.","Another issue that is yet to be resolved is regarding registration. BRTA registers vehicles based on cubic capacity (CC) whereas the capacity of EVs is not measured in CCs.
