Over 3,200MW of projects have been auctioned as of October 2022, including solar, wind and battery storage.

Prices paid by consumers were static from the early 1990s until 2017 and only covered about 54% of production costs. In 2017, the country introduced a cost-reflective tariff that removed subsidies for customers whose yearly use exceeds 150MWh (effectively commercial customers). After two steady years, the electricity price increased in 2021.","Oman has completely removed power and water subsidies for the biggest consumers including non-residential consumers such as industrial, tourism, commercial and government entities in January 2021. Starting from April 2021, Oman also introduced value-added tax (VAT) on power, which added 5% to the previous power price for Oman citizens except from those who own two accounts or less of residential category. In January 2022, the Oman Power and Water Procurement Company (OPWP) launched the region’s first spot market for the wholesale trading of electricity, allowing captive generators with excess capacity to be able to capacity through the spot market.

In 2019, Oman sold 49% of OETC's stake worth $1 billion to Chinese transmission and distribution operator, State Grid Corporation of China (SGCC).
