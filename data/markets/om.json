Oman has completely removed power and water subsidies for the biggest consumers including non-residential consumers such as industrial, tourism, commercial and government entities in January 2021. Starting from April 2021, Oman also introduced value-added tax (VAT) on power, which added 5% to the previous power price to Oman citizens except from those who owns two accounts of less of residential category.
