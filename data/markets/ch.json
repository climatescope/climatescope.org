Switzerland provides a feed-in premium for renewables, which is financed by a special fund raised through a consumer surcharge of up to 23 Swiss francs ($25) per megawatt hour. Historically, this program has mostly been used for solar project support. The Energy Strategy 2050 aims at further boosting renewable energy in order to reach the following indicative electricity generation targets: 4,400 gigawatt hours (excluding hydro) by 2020, 11,400 GWh (excluding hydro) by 2035 and 37,400 GWh average yearly hydro production by 2035. The Swiss Energy Act includes the target of adding 5,400GWh of additional renewable electricity on an annual basis by 2030 compared to 2000. Some 2,000GWh of the aforementioned 5,400GWh are to come from hydropower. In case the target is missed, quota obligations for renewable electricity may be imposed upon electricity suppliers. Net-metering has not been implemented centrally as small-scale feed-in tariff was already subsidizing rooftop solar from 2009, but some distribution system operators (DSOs) or utilities voluntarily offer virtual storage or net billing solutions."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Industrial and residential electricity prices increased by 3% each between 2019 and 2020 in Switzerland, while commercial prices were up only 1%. Wholesale electricity prices fell by more than 25% in the same period. Abundant hydro generation means that wholesale power prices in Switzerland are generally low relative to the EU average. The difference between residential peak and off-peak prices varies between 50 and 100%. There are also utilities that price differently in winter and summer. But this approach has been losing popularity in recent years."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Swiss power is traded on the EEX, though it does not have its own power exchange. Hydro accounts for more than 60% of Switzerland's installed capacity, with nuclear accounting for the next biggest slice, followed by solar. The shift away from nuclear, which makes up a third of total generation, will create a substantial gap in the mix, although the transition will not happen immediately. In 2017, voters rejected a scenario that would have had three of the country's five nuclear power plants close from 2017-2018. Instead, the Swiss Federal Nuclear Safety Inspectorate will determine how long the plants can operate safely. No new nuclear plants are to be built.","Investment in renewable energy in Switzerland peaked in 2013, at $1.2 billion. Almost $4 billion has been funneled to renewable energy projects in the country between 2014 and 2020. The bulk of this investment is in solar. The Swiss Federal Council has earmarked  470 million francs ($521 million) for solar rebates in 2021. Of this, 270 million francs will be available for small systems with an output of less than 100 kW and 200 million francs for large systems exceeding 100 kW in size. Three companies each own more than 94MW of renewable projects. These are BKW, Elektrizitaetswerk der Stadt Zuerich and Tridal.
