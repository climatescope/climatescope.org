# Methodology

## Scope

This marks the 12th anniversary of Climatescope, BloombergNEF’s annual assessment of energy transition opportunities.

Climatescope represents the collective effort of over 50 BNEF analysts, who gather detailed data on 140 markets globally – 110 emerging economies and 30 developed ones. The markets surveyed by Climatescope account for nearly all the world’s population, GDP and CO2 emissions.

## Methodology

The methodology for the 2023 edition of Climatescope includes 222 indicators and sub-indicators split among two sectors and into three key topic areas that encompass each market’s previous accomplishments, current investment environment, and future opportunities for clean energy growth. 

The two sectors – power and transport – are scored across three main parameters:

1. **Fundamentals.** These encompass a market’s key policies, market structures and barriers to the deployment of investment. This parameter includes the fundamental structures that can help renewable power and clean transport grow.

2. **Opportunities.**  These examine a market’s potential to grow its supply of renewable power and clean transport. Markets characterized by specific price dynamics and other favorable conditions offer the best opportunities for clean growth.

3. **Experience.** This takes into account a market’s achievements to date across the three sectors. Markets with greater experience deploying renewable power capacity typically offer lower risks, lower technology costs and lower costs of capital for developers. This parameter includes historical deployment of clean technologies surveyed and growth rates of investment into the sectors.

It is important to note that several key indicators that contribute to the above parameters are “levelized” against a market’s gross domestic product, population, installed capacity and generation. The methodology seeks to take into account and then discount the fact that some markets attract larger volumes of capital simply because they are bigger.

## Sectors, Parameters and Indicators

Below is a complete list of indicators used in Climatescope. These are subdivided first by sector, then by parameter and category.

## Power

### Fundamentals

#### Policy – Renewable energy:
- **Auctions/tenders:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. Renewable energy auctions or tenders are transparent competitive processes used to establish long-term contracts between energy generators and consumers. In the renewable energy sector, auctions are used to introduce competition among potential power producers and allow for a more efficient allocation of capital.
- **Renewable energy target:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. A renewable energy target is a medium- or long-term goal for the total clean power consumption, generation, or installed capacity that a market aims to reach by a specific year. Renewable energy targets are set by the government and are typically published in energy laws, national plans, strategies, or Nationally Determined Contributions – market’s plans to help achieve the goals of the Paris Agreement. 
- **Feed-in tariff/premium:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. A feed-in-tariff or premium is an above-market price payment given to renewable energy producers for the electricity that they deliver to the grid.
- **Net metering/billing:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. Net metering (or net billing) allows retail electricity consumers to install self-generation facilities (typically distributed solar panels), interconnect with the electricity utility and deliver surplus power generation to the grid. Consumers typically obtain compensation in the form of billing credit or direct payments.
- **Accelerated depreciation:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. Accelerated depreciation for renewable energy projects is a depreciation method in which renewable energy assets reduce their book values at a faster rate than they would using traditional depreciation methods. This incentive ultimately results in a tax reduction.
- **Import tax reduction/exemption:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. Import tax reduction or exemptions for renewable energy aim to lower or eliminate import duties paid on components used to build clean energy power projects.
- **VAT reduction/exemption:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. A value-added tax (VAT) is tax applied on goods and services, common in most economies. The reduction or exemption of this tax for renewable energy decreases the costs of components used to build clean power plants and consequently incentivizes renewables buildout.
- **Priority grid access:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. Priority access means the grid operators at the distribution level are obliged to connect to renewables installations. In an overload situation, the connection of renewables is prioritized instead of fossil fuels.
- **Renewables mandate/renewable energy certificate:** Rewards markets that have this policy in force, be it national or at the state or provincial level, with national legislation accounting for a higher score. A renewable energy certificate (REC) is a voluntary market instrument that certifies that power was produced by a renewable energy source. A certificate is issued for each megawatt-hour of electricity delivered to the grid and is typically either bundled with and priced into a power purchase agreement or sold to entities aiming to offset their emissions. While there is policy support to maintain the structure, it is purely a corporate commitment on either side, buyer or seller. ‘REC’ is the name of such certificates in the US and they can more broadly be called ‘energy attribution certificates’ (EACs). Essentially, I-Recs, Guarantees of Origin and other national certificates are EACs used for tracking, but their scope varies depending on regulation and the market of use (such as the example of US RECs and some utilities).

#### Policy – Climate change:

- **NDC target coverage:** Rewards markets based on the number of sectors that are covered by their emission reduction goals.
- **NDC target type:** Rewards markets that detail their emission reduction goals in absolute terms the most, followed by those that use emission intensity targets. Markets that propose to reduce emissions against a historical trend receive the least points.
- **NDC target updated:** Rewards markets that have updated their NDCs or submitted a new document since 2019.
- **Long term strategy:** Rewards markets that have submitted their long-term strategy detailing how they will reduce emissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change.

#### Power sector – General:

- **Power purchase agreements (PPA) of sufficient duration:** Rewards markets based on the length of PPAs that are typically awarded to renewables developers, giving more points to longer-term PPAs.
- **Standardized PPAs:** Awards points to markets where standardized PPAs can be used by renewables developers to accelerate negotiations.
- **Currency of power-purchase agreements:** Awards points to markets where developers can sign PPAs that guarantee payment for power delivered in US dollars or euros.
- **Retail market liberalization:** Awards points to markets in which the retail of electricity is open to competition and where developers can sign PPAs directly with consumers.
- **Bilateral power contracts:** Rewards markets where commercial and industrial customers can sign both on- and offsite long-term contracts for clean energy.

- **Clear rules on interconnection:** Rewards markets where the rules for connecting renewables assets to the grid are clear and transparent.
- **Wholesale power market:** Awards points to markets where electricity dispatch is done on a marginal-cost basis and where a wholesale power exchange is in place.

#### Power sector – Wholesale:

- **Utility privatization:** Rewards markets where generation, transmission and/or retail of electricity is open to private sector participation. The generation segment is worth twice as many points as transmission and retail, which often remains the prerogative of public entities and is not a barrier to clean energy investment.
- **Utility unbundling:** Rewards markets where the generation, transmission and retail segments of the electricity sector are separated.
- **Concentration of generation market:** Rewards markets in which the electricity generation market is not concentrated.
- **Independent power transmission:** Rewards markets in which the entity responsible for the transportation of electricity is not involved in other segments of the power market.
- **Purchase obligation:** Rewards markets where the electricity offtaker is mandated to purchase all electricity produced by renewables developers.
- **Clear rules on arrival of the main grid:** Rewards markets with clear rules on the sanctity of private assets developed in regions where the main power retailers, such as state-owned utilities, are not yet active. Typically, these rules involve the state or utility being required to purchase the private asset at a fair market value, or the asset being granted independent power producer status within the grid. Such policies help protect privately developed mini-grids built where the grid does not yet exist.
