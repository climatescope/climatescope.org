## Clean buildings policies

Heat pump purchase incentives are present in 24 of the markets surveyed, making them the most popular such policy on the books. Low-carbon heat targets or roadmaps, which are in place in 76% of covered markets, are a close second. Tax credits and boiler scrappage are also relatively popular, with roughly 50% of markets using these to support heat pump adoption.
