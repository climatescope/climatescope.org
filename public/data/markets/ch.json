Historically, this program has mostly been used for solar project support. It is due to expire at the end of 2022 and no new systems will be included in the funding system thereafter.","The Swiss Federal Council in June 2021 adopted a new law that set bidding rules to raise new renewable power generation to at least 17 terawatt-hours in 2035 and 39 terawatt-hours in 2050 and hydropower generation to at least 37.4 terawatt-hours in 2035 and 38.6 terawatt-hours in 2050. Moreover, the country wants to add 2 terawatt-hours of hydropower storage production available in winter by 2040 to be funded by a surcharge of 0.20 Swiss francs per kilowatt-hour.

However, the gradual transition has been underway since 2011 when the federal government decided to phase out nuclear power. An amendment to the Swiss Nuclear Energy Act came into effect in January 2018, which ceased the issuing of new general licenses for nuclear plants.","In 2021, there was one solar corporate power purchase agreement signed in Switzerland.
