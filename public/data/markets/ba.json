The two regions have separate governments and determine their energy policy independently. Each region has a separate feed-in tariff, with Republika Srpska additionally offering a feed-in premium, although these schemes have only encouraged the build-out of smaller plants so far.","In theory, renewable energy producers with feed-in tariff contracts receive priority grid access. However, it can be a difficult and bureaucratic procedure to secure a connection in practice. State utilities have negotiated deals for larger wind farms directly with the government.","Both FBiH and Republic of Srpska have auctions in place, although transparency is lacking. A net-metering scheme is used for small producers for up to 50 kilowatts and in Republika Srpska, self-generation is encouraged by offering a premium for the electricity produced.","The country aimed to achieve a 40% share of renewable energy in total final consumption 2020, although poor transparency over the projects that received government support means it remains unclear whether these planned quotas were fulfilled.

A new coal-fired power station was completed in 2016, beginning the process of replacing the aging coal fleet. Another coal plant, Tuzla 7, is currently under development, despite the Energy Community – a European energy body – bringing infringement proceedings against the country.","Renewable energy capacity in Bosnia and Herzegovina is minimal, but includes wind, solar, biomass and small hydro. The country’s first wind farm was commissioned in Mesihovina in 2018, and comprises 22 turbines with an installed capacity of 51 megawatts (MW). In 2021, a 15 turbine, 48MW wind farm was completed in Podvelezje.","Most renewables investment has come from international concessional lenders, including the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). In addition to domestic funds and government grants, organizations such as the United Nations Development Program and US Agency for International Development (USAID) provide co-financing and technical assistance.","While Bosnia and Herzegovina’s electricity sector is open to private participation, generation and distribution are overwhelmingly undertaken by three vertically integrated public utilities whose remit is geographically distributed. There are, however, some larger wind projects developed by foreign players and local developers have also built small-scale hydro.","Distribution system operators are still bundled with electricity retail in FBiH, and with electricity supply in Republika Srpska. The EU initiated an infringement case against Bosnia and Herzegovina for its lack of progress in utility unbundling, saying it presented a substantial obstacle to competition.\nThere are no corporate power purchase agreements in the country as most generators are still enjoying the benefits of feed-in tariffs."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Obtaining a permit is the single largest barrier faced by renewable energy developers in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Approval is required from many different levels of government and the requirements can vary by region. Disagreements between various government departments are hampering the establishment of an adequate electricity transmission system and the construction of power lines to connect wind and solar power plants.","Local opposition is an additional obstacle for renewables projects. Only companies that have location and environmental permits can apply for auctions and premiums.","To meet its climate goals, Bosnia and Herzegovina will need substantial international assistance for technology transfer, to set up financial mechanisms to encourage decarbonization (gas is currently subsidized in Sarajevo), and financial support for climate-related projects.
