The target is broken down into technology-specific chunks, the largest of which is 40GW of PV. It is unlikely that the government will meet an interim target of 27.3GW of renewables by 2023 – the objective no longer features in official announcements. The country’s renewables sector has had a few false starts, but recent activity signals progress. As of October 2020, some 3.4GW of solar and wind capacity had been auctioned through the country’s main auction program, REPDO. The national sovereign wealth fund is also playing a central role in procuring clean capacity, albeit through a framework that is somewhat opaque than REPDO. For its part, small-scale solar is likely to be buoyed by the publication of a new net-metering framework in July 2020, and additional measures to train installers and facilitate installations announced in February 2021."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["As with other countries in the region, Saudi Arabia has seen record low bids over recent years. These include a $21.30/MWh levelized bid in January 2019 for Dumat al-Jandal, the country’s first auctioned wind farm. Meanwhile, falling equipment costs, free land, zero connection costs and cheap labor have made PV the most competitive source of new bulk generation. Saudi Arabia is moreover committing to an ambitious subsidy-removal program, stripping away measures keeping down the price of natural gas and oil. Although it looks like subsidies for generation fuel will remain in place for now, retail power prices are being increased for all customer types. Such efforts are aligned with Saudi Vision 2030, which aims to diversify the economy away from oil while increasing the role of the private sector."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Gas generation plays an important role in the country’s east, while western regions rely on burning oil for power. Plans exist to convert western oil plants to gas, although progress in this area is lagging. Renewables additions have increased substantially in recent years from a low base – capacity awarded through Rounds 2 and 3 of the REPDO auction program suggest that this will continue. However, investors may be deterred by a lack of visibility on future procurement schemes. The country’s partially unbundled power sector remains dominated by the state utility, and private-to-private power purchase agreements are not yet explicitly allowed. Contracts signed with renewables developers are take-or-pay, guaranteeing that power be purchased regardless of demand."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Peak electricity demand has grown steadily, rising from 46GW to 61GW over 2010-20. Growth is likely to resume despite the economic impact of the pandemic. Besides the conversion of western oil plants to gas, policymakers are mulling the relative benefits of using domestic gas resources versus liquefied natural gas, terminals for which have yet to be built. In the long run, world-beating renewables resources are likely to undercut such investments. Moreover, the amount of power used by desalination processes is likely to reduce as the country switches from existing thermal plants to installations employing reverse osmosis."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["The government had in fact banned EVs from being imported into Saudi Arabia for commercial use (personal use was allowed) in 2017; this was only lifted in August 2021.
