The federal government is aiming for 4 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind capacity to be installed by 2030 to help achieve these goals. The three regions within Belgium all have their own targets for renewable energy production.","Belgium held foursolar auction by 2022, and plans to hold two offshore wind auctions totaling 4.5GW in capacity. Renewables are procured through green certificates issued for the production of renewable power. These are then purchased by obligated retailers before being bought by the transmission system operator. Over time, the green certificates mechanism will be merged with the competitive tendering procedure for projects. This will make it possible to meet Belgium’s efficiency objectives while complying with the EU's move towards greater market integration.","Belgium has adopted certain tax and grid tariff exemptions for rooftop solar and energy storage. In the case of rooftop solar, a reduced 6% VAT rate applies to labor costs for fitting the installation. There is also a series of subsidies in place in the Flanders region for specific types of energy storage, such as home batteries. To encourage solar power self-consumption, Flanders is granting rebates for the installation of residential battery systems.","Net-metering schemes differ in all three of the country’s regions, just like priority grid access, which is only available in Flanders region.","Amid the existence of baseload nuclear capacity and the success of renewables, gas-fired turbines have been mothballed in Belgium due to the lack of price incentives to keep them operational. The country’s energy market lacked sufficient price signals to trigger investment in much-needed swing capacity, so to ensure there is sufficient flexible capacity available when needed (such as when there is little wind or sun), Belgium introduced a capacity remuneration mechanism (CRM) in March 2021. The CRM takes the form of capacity contracts that pay successful bidders a premium in addition to their revenues on the electricity market. The results of the first annual capacity auction were announced at the end of October 2021, with combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants securing almost 80% of the total 4.6GW of auctioned volume."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["The levelized cost of energy for utility-scale clean power projects in Belgium is generally higher than most mature renewables markets in Europe. The lack of a large-scale auction program has made it difficult to achieve economies of scale.","Wholesale power prices are largely determined by outages affecting the country’s nuclear reactor fleet and those of its neighbors. It is a significant importer of power. Spot prices tend to be slightly higher than those in France, Germany, and the Netherlands.","In 2021 specifically, the wholesale market price increased drastically as the economy recovered post the pandemic and gas supply dipped.","Residential and commercial retail power bills had increased steadily over the last decade before falling in 2020 and going back up again in 2021. With the market for ‘prosumers’ – households that both produce and consume energy– increasing every year, retailers have started to develop specific products to attract them. For example, for customers with rooftop solar PV systems, Eneco offers a tariff whereby electricity is priced throughout the day at a cheaper night tariff."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Private players can participate across Belgium’s power sector, which has been unbundled and liberalized. There has been steady growth in renewables across all main generating technologies. The penetration of rooftop solar has reached 17%, the highest in all of Europe.

That said, the need to replace the nuclear reactor fleet clears the way for new investments in generation assets. Continued growth of residential solar is expected, while space constraints and acceptance issues could hinder growth in utility-scale onshore wind and solar PV. Moreover, developers often struggle to navigate the various regulatory differences engendered by Belgium’s federal structure. Regarding regional specific matters, while Flanders has restricted territorial possibilities and insufficient grid capacity for renewables plants, Wallonia faces high distribution grid access tariffs. This complicates the task of accessing region-specific support mechanisms, although once identified, the available subsidy mechanisms are reported to be efficient.","Import duties and VAT rates are not lower for clean power equipment in Belgium, but many direct and indirect federal incentives for fossil fuels are granted in the form of tax exemptions or reduced rates of excise duty. One of the sectors where further subsidies are probable is hydrogen. On October 2021, the hydrogen strategy of the Federal Minister of Energy (Tinne Van der Straeten) was approved.
