Additionally, commercial and industrial power projects are growing in popularity, especially around renewable energy.

There is a small uptake in renewable energy, mainly wind power, which grew over 500% between 2019 and 2020. Renewable energy represents 2.5% (excluding large hydro) of the total installed capacity of Russia. Renewables grew slowly in the last decade, and represented around 1.1% of capacity in 2010. Russian utilities are indebted given the sanctions and restrictions post the Ukraine invasion. Power prices are very high in Russia, so while producers were not historically in debt, many consumers are. The government provides high subsidies on fossil fuel, making producing renewable energy less attractive. Local network companies are obliged to purchase electricity produced by renewable energy units but only to cover 5% of their network losses.","According to a Government Decree (No. 1472-R) of July 28, 2015, local content requirements apply to all wind, solar PV and small hydropower projects. By 2024, requirements will reach 70% of all equipment used for solar PV and 65% for small hydropower and wind. As of mid-2017, the average age of Russian power plants was 32.5 years, likely to only have grown since then, as little investment is going into new capacity. A capacity mechanism is available to support modernization in the first stage, from 2022-25, under the \"Thermal Power Plant Modernization Program Based on Capacity Delivery Agreements.\" About 1.9 trillion rubles ($29 billion) should cover 41GW over 2022-31.
