As part of its 2019 National Energy and Climate Plan, Italy aimed to achieve 26% of electricity generation from renewables in 2020, rising to 55% in 2030. It also laid out a target for 30% of final energy consumption to come from renewables in 2030, from 17% in 2020.","To boost renewables deployment, the Ministry of Economic Development enforced a new decree implementing a technology-neutral auction system in July 2019. The auction scheme aims to procure 6.2 gigawatts (GW) of renewable energy capacity over seven rounds, to meet its 2030 targets.","Italy is also striving toward increasing grid interconnection with the rest of Europe and has set ambitious goals for clean hydrogen.

In 2019, it passed legislation to revive its renewables sector, which had been struggling since the end of utility-scale solar subsidies in 2013. It decided to host seven technology-neutral auctions to procure 6.2 gigawatts (GW) of renewable capacity. Auction winners secure 20-year contracts that guarantee them a power price.

Wholesale power prices reflect the marginal cost of generation at the zonal level. Prices only converge to the national single price (known as the PUN) when there is no congestion. Italy has recently improved transmission network bottlenecks between the Northern and Southern regions of the country, leading to power price convergence across the bidding zones.","Italy’s wholesale and retail power prices are among the highest in Europe.
