The CHP plants are mainly fueled by biomass and waste, with coal and peat making up a smaller share of the fuel mix.

The share of wind generation has grown rapidly, from around 3% in 2015 to 12% in 2020.","Some 141 new wind farms were commissioned in Finland during 2021. Around 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of subsidy-free wind farms are either in the pipeline or newly commissioned, as 14 corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed between 2015 and mid-2022. Utility-scale solar has not taken off, but distributed solar capacity reached 400 megawatts (MW) in 2021.

However, increased use of biofuels could also help achieve the country’s renewable energy in transport target.","Finland’s tax regime favors low-emission vehicles, as the purchase tax is determined by the CO2 intensity of the vehicle. The purchase tax is charged in addition to value added tax and can be as high as 30% of the purchase price for cars with emissions over 200 grams of CO2 per kilometer. That compares to just 2.7% for BEVs.","There are also subsidies on offer to encourage EV adoption and the installation of chargers.

Meanwhile, housing associations managing multi-family buildings can receive support for 35% of the installation cost for EV chargers, up to a maximum of €90,000 through the ARA scheme.
