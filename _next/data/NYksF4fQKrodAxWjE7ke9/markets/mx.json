Though strong support for renewable energy is embedded in the reforms that have transformed Mexico’s energy sector, progress on market reform and support for renewable energy has stalled under President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, who is known as AMLO. AMLO has challenged energy reform and sought to block the growth of renewables with the aim of supporting the state-utility CFE.","In 2012, Mexico established a mandate to generate 35% of power from clean sources by 2024. It authorized a Clean Energy Certificates (CEL) market in 2014. It also introduced a renewables mandate for power consumption, applying to all large consumers in the market including CFE, that began at 5% in 2018 and rises to 13.9% in 2022.","Since taking office AMLO has canceled Mexico’s highly successful renewables auction program, sought to dilute the CEL market, sidelined clean-energy targets and eliminated legacy benefits that wind and solar plants received.

The CFE continues to hold the majority of generation assets and a monopoly on transmission and distribution. Deregulation of generation in 2016 created Mexico’s wholesale market, which has operated on a day-ahead basis since January 2016.","Mexico held two auctions in 2016 and one in 2017, contracting a total of 19.8TWh of clean power, 1.8GW of firm capacity and 20.6 million CELs. Mexico's fourth auction, expected to be held in November 2018, was repeatedly delayed and then canceled in January 2019.

However, prices in Mexico’s wholesale market dropped to $27/MWh on average in the National Interconnected System (SIN) from $71/MWh in 2019 as demand slumped.

This share is expected to grow with further investment, which continues despite the cancellation of the country’s auctions and other adverse policy measures. The country’s three auctions held over 2016-17 catalyzed investor interest in the country’s strong wind and solar resources, producing a step change in Mexico new clean-energy investment from 2017 on, which has averaged around $3.6 billion per year over the past five years.","Power in Mexico remains heavily weighted toward fossil fuels, with natural gas, oil and coal together accounting for 69% of capacity and 76% of generation in 2020. Large hydro accounted for 7% of generation, and renewables met 14%. At the end of 2020, Mexico had over 6 gigawatts of wind capacity and commissioned utility-scale PV capacity of over 5 gigawatts. Wind and solar, which are closely associated with market-opening energy reform and private investment, have only recently entered the CFE’s planning. Official plans for the CFE are more focused on revamping its large hydro fleet and expanding its fossil fuel portfolio, primarily with gas plants."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["While Mexico's energy reform has increased private participation in generation, the market remains highly concentrated in the hands of CFE, which controls approximately 54% of capacity. Efforts to strengthen state control under AMLO have raised questions around the durability of reform and undermined investor confidence in Mexico’s clean-energy market.","Policy changes introduced by the Ministry of Energy (Sener) in 2020, and since suspended, sought to reverse a core achievement of prior reforms: a competitive, cost-based power market. The new regulations would have given priority to CFE power plants by endowing market operator Cenace with permanent authority to prioritize dispatch based on reliability rather than cost. The step would have ensured that zero-marginal-cost renewables do not undercut and eventually displace CFE plants, many of which are aging thermal generators. Prioritizing these costly units would essentially mark a return to Mexico’s pre-reform power market. The ministry has said it will challenge the suspension of the policy in court.","A bill presented to congress in September 2021 would amend the constitution to return control of the electricity market to the state utility, including canceling most permits awarded to private companies, ensure state-owned CFE retains the majority of the market and end Mexico’s independent energy regulators."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Mexico’s EV market is small and the share of EVs in new vehicle sales is well under 1%.

This was aimed at reducing energy consumption tied to air conditioning systems and mainly targeted new single-family housing and multi-unit residential buildings. CONUEE issued the first standard for commercial buildings in 2001, also aimed at reducing heat gains. Compliance with both standards is low due to weak local government enforcement.
