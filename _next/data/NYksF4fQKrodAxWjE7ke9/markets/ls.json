In 2018, Lesotho imported 30% of its power from neighboring South Africa. While its domestic fleet is composed entirely of hydro, South Africa's grid is composed of 90% coal power. Between its domestic production and imports, Lesotho's average carbon intensity is about 0.218 CO2 kg/KWh. Expansion of its domestic fleet with renewable energy will reduce import volumes and lower the carbon footprint of the power sector.
