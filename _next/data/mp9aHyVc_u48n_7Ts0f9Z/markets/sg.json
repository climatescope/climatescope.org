Singapore targets deploying at least 2 gigawatts of solar capacity by 2030, with an accelerated target of 1.5 gigawatts by 2025. Much of the development is constrained to rooftops and floating solar as the city state’s lack of land resources (indicated by the high population density) has proved an obstacle for ground-mounted grid-scale development.","The SolarNova program, which aggregates demand and rooftop space across public housing, schools and government buildings, has been the driving force for solar PV adoption. To date, the Energy Development Board and the Housing Development Board issued seven SolarNova tenders, committing 380 megawatts of capacity.","Floating solar is also increasingly becoming an area of focus as the government looks to maximize available space for solar installations. In 2021, Sunseap installed a 5-megawatt offshore floating solar plant in the Straits of Johor; Sembcorp has also completed a 60-megawatt floating solar plant on the Tengeh Reservoir.
