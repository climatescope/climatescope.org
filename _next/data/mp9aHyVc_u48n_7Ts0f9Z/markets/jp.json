Japan has also announced the Clean Energy Strategy with plans to issue 20 trillion yen ($144 billion) of government bonds for the energy transition until the early 2030s.

The targets are: 38% in the industry sector, 51% in the commercial sector, 66% in the residential sector, 35% in the transport sector, and 47% through energy transformation.

Fossil sources accounted for more than 70% of Japan’s annual generation mix in 2021, half of which comes from natural gas. Feed-in tariff subsidies introduced in 2012 boosted the shares of solar and wind in the nation’s power supply to 9% and 1% by 2021 from essentially zero.","The sixth Strategic Energy Plan calls for more renewables in the country’s 2030 power mix at the expense of thermal power plants. The government aims for 38% of the 2030 power supply to come from renewables. Offshore wind is a key focus; the government plans to host 30-45 gigawatts of offshore wind auctions by 2040. For nuclear, the government remains keen to resume the operation of more reactors despite the slow pace of restarts due to strong public opposition. The government aims to have 36 nuclear reactors operational by the end of the decade, from just 10 active reactors in 2022, and for nuclear to account for 20-22% of the country’s power mix."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Electricity retail is classified into three segments by voltage levels: low voltage for the residential sector, high voltage for the commercial sector, and extra-high voltage for the industrial sector.

The vast majority of generation assets – which could be higher than 85% – are owned by incumbent utilities, which makes it difficult for new entrants to compete in retail markets.","Since power demand is expected to fall amid a shrinking population and an economic slowdown, opportunities for new capacity additions are limited except for the replacement of retiring capacity. Japan has 10 different power markets. Each region is poorly connected, resulting in price distortion between east and west regions in the wholesale market.

Similarly, subsidies for EV chargers and hydrogen refueling stations are available. Another support for cleaner vehicles is reduced taxes on vehicle purchasing and vehicle inspections.
