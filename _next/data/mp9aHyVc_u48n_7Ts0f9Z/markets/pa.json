The country’s efforts to promote renewables development include tax policies and duty exemptions, but it no longer holds tenders specifically for clean energy contracts. Following legislative changes, state-owned Electric Transmission Company (ETESA) announced in February 2018 that there will be no further tenders expressly to solicit bids from clean energy projects. Instead, all generation sources will compete for contracts. However, ETESA also said technologies will be evaluated based on their environmental attributes and associated costs.","Panama has had tax incentives for the construction, operation and maintenance of clean energy projects since 2004. Renewable generators up to 500 kilowatts are exempt from all taxes on imported equipment as well as value-added tax (VAT). For renewable generators up to 10 megawatts, an income tax credit of up to 25% of the project investment is provided. For generators of more than 10 megawatts, there is a fiscal benefit of 25% and an income tax credit of up to 50% of the project investment. The law also exempts transmission and distribution fees for smaller renewable energy projects up to 10 megawatts, while projects between 10 and 20 megawatts do not pay transmission or distribution fees for the first 10 megawatts for 10 years.","Further incentives for specific technologies are also available. For example, solar PV equipment is exempt from import tax and VAT, and qualifies for a tax credit of up to 5% for income tax and accelerated depreciation. Further, equipment, materials and spare parts for wind generation plants are exempt from all international duties, fees, VAT and import tax. Wind project owners are also exempt from national taxes for 15 years.","A net metering policy was instated in 2016, creating the rules to set up self-generation facilities and allowing connection to the distribution grid and the sale of surplus power.

In 2021, Panama launched a Covid-19 energy subsidy covering 92% of customers consuming up to 750 kilowatt-hours. The subsidy varies based on consumption.","Power prices rose across all of Panama’s customer segments from 2016 to 2019 before dropping across the board in 2020. However, in 2021, changes in prices varied across segments. Commercial power prices dropped from $195 to $177 per megawatt-hour, industrial prices fell from $126 to $153 per megawatt-hour, and wholesale prices rose from $48 to $71 per megawatt-hour.
