This lays out an aim to lower greenhouse gas emissions by 2% by 2030 versus anticipated levels in a business-as-usual scenario. With international financial and technological support, Mozambique says it could reduce its emissions further, by a total of 21% by 2030 versus business as usual. The cost of the mitigation and adaptation measures included in the NDC is almost $49 billion.","The bulk of the DRC’s emissions are from forestry and other land use, and agriculture. The 2030 NDC goal rests upon emissions falling by 43% from agriculture, 28% from forestry, 20% from the waste sector and 11% from energy."]},{"key":3,"title":"Fossil fuel phase-out policy","text":["The DRC does not yet have a fossil fuel phase-out policy."]}]},{"key":2,"title":"Power","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Power policy","text":["The DRC’s power sector is still at a very early stage of growth. The vast majority of the country’s domestic power generation – some 96% – comes from hydropower, mostly from the Inga I and Inga II dams in Kongo Central province. In terms of expanding other renewable power sources, such as wind or solar, there are no auctions or tenders in place, nor a net metering or billing policy.","The DRC does not have an accelerated depreciation policy for clean energy projects, but companies can negotiate on an individual basis. In terms of incentives, all economic activities related to the production, import and export of electrical energy are exempt from customs tax and, in certain cases, valued-added tax (VAT) for four years from the first day of importation. This applies to all energy sources. However, the VAT exemption is not transparent and is not continuously applied."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["The DRC’s government subsidizes electricity prices by setting a ceiling price for electricity sold, although in most cases, this is less than the cost of generation. The country does not have any time-based tariffs.","There are no specific rules for mini-grid project ownership and what happens after they start supplying to the grid. However, projects seeking to transmit over longer distances have to sell to the government monopoly, Societe Nationale d'Electricite (SNEL), which is inefficient in revenue retrieval.","Some companies have come up with innovative ways to retrieve tariffs directly from clients. For example, Dev Solaire offers pay-as-you-go (PAYG) to its customers, and Electricite de Congo (EDC) has a proprietary prepayment platform where meters are charged with a code purchased at an EDC shop."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Although the DRC’s power market was liberalized in principle in 2013, all segments are still controlled and managed by the Ministry of Energy. The point of liberalization was to enable other players to compete with state utility SNEL, but the agency to regulate the sector has not yet been set up. Although SNEL legally shifted from being state owned to a limited liability company, this has not had any material impact on wider market competition.","Power purchase agreements (PPAs) are negotiated on an individual basis and the government has not yet publicly auctioned any PPAs. There are no restrictions on commercial and industrial partners signing power contracts for internal use and for provision of power to communities externally. Some companies and churches have such arrangements with independent producers and communities.","The DRC aims to improve electricity access from about 15% presently to 65% by 2025, and hope to achieve universal access by 2050. The energy access initiatives are mostly being driven by developmental bodies working with the DRC government, including Sustainable Energy for All (SEA4ALL), UKAid and USAID.","Mining companies represent a significant market for power generation in the DRC. The national utility provider, SNEL, is only able to provide a fraction of what the industry requires to operate at full capacity. Almost all mining companies rely on backup diesel generators due to the intermittent supply from the national grid."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["There are many barriers that impact the ability of decentralized power projects to take off, particularly end users’ ability to pay and utility providers’ ability to recover fees. This is coupled with the unreliable nature of the DRC’s grid. Due to the low electricity tariffs set by the government, the main generator, SNEL, has had to cut back on maintenance for decades, resulting in a rundown power infrastructure system. There is, however, an official program to upgrade this infrastructure."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["The government has yet to implement any substantive policy support in this sector and the electric vehicle market remains at an early stage."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["The government has yet to implement any substantive policy support in this sector and the electric vehicle market remains at an early stage."]},{"key":3,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["The government has yet to implement any substantive policy support in this sector and the electric vehicle market remains at an early stage."]}]},{"key":4,"title":"Buildings","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Buildings market","text":["The climate of the DRC means the focus is on cooling rather than heating buildings.
