Little progress has been made on these targets, however, since the country depends on external funding to reach them.","The government’s Action Plan for 2014-17 aimed to increase renewables capacity from 75 megawatts (MW) to 1,000MW. However, no progress has been made as the state of the main grid has prevented new generation assets from being connected. The only incentive for renewable energy is a reduction in import taxes on solar products."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Sierra Leone’s grid customers are from the residential, small commercial or public sector. Electricity prices are regulated by the Water and Electricity Regulatory Commission, and they have been kept stable since the rise back in 2019. As of 2020, grid electricity prices are subsidized for the residential sector at 644 leone ($0.07) per kilowatt-hour (kWh) for the first 25kWh, and 1,600 leone/kWh for further consumption. A 15% tax rate is applied in both cases. Commercial users and institutions pay around 1,800 leone/kWh plus a 15% tax. Large energy users generate and consume their own power or have on-site power purchase agreements, since the country’s electricity grid is not reliable.","Off-grid electricity prices in mini-grid sites are regulated, but generally not subsidized. The European Union funded three sites with capacities ranging from 66-127kW, in a project called PRESSD-SL, and the United Nations Office for Project Services (UNOPS) funded a mini-grid project that identified 94 sites. By 2020, 60 sites with an individual capacity of around 6-14kW were built.

Most of the power plants are publicly owned and seem to operate in poor conditions. Independent Power Producers or IPPs must sell their electricity to the Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA), the state-owned main utility, although the regulator can provide retail licenses to other suppliers in areas where the grid is not available.","Sierra Leone’s power system only has one transmission grid, which joins the main hydro power plant with the capital city, Freetown.
