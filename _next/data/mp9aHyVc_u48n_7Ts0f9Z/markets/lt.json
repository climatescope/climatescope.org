The Renovation of Modern Apartment Buildings program allows participating owners to receive 30% rebates for renovations they make to improve efficiency.","The country’s Long-Term Renovation Strategy includes a goal to reduce the annual primary energy consumption of buildings by 60% from 2020-2050, and to cut annual consumption of primary energy from fossil fuels to zero across this period. The strategy also aims to lower CO2 emissions from the buildings stock to zero by mid-century. These targets rely on a concurrent transformation of the power sector to shift to renewable energy.","Lithuania is aiming for two-thirds of its final energy consumption for heating and cooling to be powered by renewables by 2030. To decarbonize and improve the energy efficiency of heating, the “Replacement of Boilers in Households” regulation was introduced to incentivize households to upgrade old, inefficient biomass boilers with more efficient models, or replace them with heat pumps. With a program budget of around €4.8 million, the subsidy covered 50% of expenses and the last call for applications was from January to February 2022.","Meanwhile, the city council of Lithuania’s capital Vilnius has decided to phase out the use of coal for heating, with the ban due to take effect in June 2023."]},{"key":3,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Lithuania lags behind EU standards for energy efficiency in the building sector.
