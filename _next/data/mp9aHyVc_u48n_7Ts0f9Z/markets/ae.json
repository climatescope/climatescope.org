A federal target for a 24% renewables share by 2021 will not be met. The UAE’s federal structure affords each of the emirates considerable autonomy in implementing their own renewables targets, incentives and procurement schemes. Abu Dhabi and Dubai have had considerable success in running large-scale, competitive auctions to procure solar power. However, success has been varied in certain areas. Abu Dhabi has, for instance, struggled to replicate the success of Dubai’s net-metering scheme even as it has proven its ability to pull off large-scale renewables auctions."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Developers of solar utility-scale projects benefit from excellent irradiation levels, economies of scale and low development costs. Yet rock-bottom auction prices are also made possible by implicit subsidies, such as the fact that developers need pay for neither land nor a grid connection. Headline-grabbing bids have resulted, including a near-world record of $13.50 per megawatt-hour for Abu Dhabi’s last solar auction in July 2020.","Moreover, state utilities retain majority stakes in all utility-scale projects, reducing the cost of debt. Renewables are increasingly able to undercut fossil-fuel generators, for which fuel subsidies were removed in 2015. However, fossil-fuel generators continue to receive indirect support in the form of subsidized retail tariffs. For instance, residential prices have remained unchanged in Dubai over much of the last decade."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The UAE’s grid is fragmented among the various emirates, but gas remains the dominant form of power generation across the board. Representing 8% of installed capacity in 2019, renewables penetration is starting to ramp up. In the absence of a wholesale market, developers sell their power through take-or-pay contracts – their output is purchased regardless of demand. Independent power producers account for most of the commissioned capacity, although the publicly owned utilities retain a major equity share in all projects. For its part, Abu Dhabi’s state utility – which is also active in the northern emirates – has been unbundled, although Dubai’s remains vertically integrated. Both retain single-buyer status, while generation is the only sector open to private participation."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Power demand has risen rapidly in recent decades, growing from 17 gigawatts to 23 gigawatts over 2010-2021. There is a lack of visibility on tenders going forward, and much of the power fleet is relatively young.

One incentive is Dubai’s provision of a free Salik tag (used to pay toll fees) upon registering an EV, but drivers are still liable for booth charges. The difference this makes is minimal, as the Salik tag is provided at a cost of some $20.
