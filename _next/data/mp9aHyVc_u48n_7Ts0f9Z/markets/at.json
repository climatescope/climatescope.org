The government also aims to install 1 million rooftop solar photovoltaic (PV) systems by 2030 under its Climate and Energy Strategy “#mission2030” initiatives. Renewables are supported through feed-in tariffs and upfront capital grants in the case of small hydro and solar projects, although the government drafted a new energy law to transition to a premium-based auction system. Originally due by 2021, the final law came into effect  in the second half of 2022.","Austrian law sets priority dispatch for renewable energy projects over other, non-renewable sources to meet the grid’s demands.","The country has had an energy storage subsidy in place since October 2019. An amendment to the Green Electricity Act provides up to €12 million in subsidies for storage systems for three years with a limit of 50 kilowatt-hours per plant."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Austria’s wholesale power prices are lower than most of neighboring countries due mainly to an abundance of large hydroelectric generation. Cheap hydro has long reduced the impetus to invest in other renewables, although this has begun to change as renewables’ costs have fallen. Meanwhile, the country’s low-carbon power fleet has largely been shielded from the rising EU carbon price.","Austria has seen electricity prices grow steadily over the years for commercial, industrial and residential users, from €144.65; €92.53 and €196.40 per megawatt-hour, respectively, in 2017, to €173.95; €132.95 and €225.05 per megawatt-hour in 2021. With the even more drastic increases in prices in March 2022 amid an energy crisis in Europe, Austria unveiled a new energy costs package. This included measures to provide relief worth around €560 to each person receiving the minimum pension."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Various hydroelectric technologies provide the bulk of generation and flexibility services in Austria – pumped, small and large hydro installations accounted for more than 60% of the 19 gigawatts of installed capacity in 2021.","Other renewables – mainly rooftop PV and onshore wind – have grown from a low base over the last decade to more than 2 gigawatts. The power sector has been partly unbundled and liberalized, but the state retains a central role. Publicly owned utilities are the predominant owners of renewables capacity, with Land Burgenland and Verbund topping the list.","All segments of the country’s power sector are open to private participation, except transmission. Companies have only signed a few bilateral power-purchase agreements with clean energy projects, partly due to the availability of cheap hydropower. Austria also has some lithium-ion battery production facilities, including factories owned by South Korean electric-car battery maker Samsung SDI Co. and Germany-headquartered BMZ Group."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Austrian electricity demand is rising gradually, but growth is unlikely to accelerate without expanded efforts to electrify the country’s heating, industry and transportation sectors. Austria has relatively unremarkable wind or solar resources.","A shift toward organized auctions to procure clean power is underway, but details as to when tenders will be held have yet to be announced. Adding to the uncertainty, investors currently have little visibility on how the framework will ultimately work. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, policymakers had delayed the phase-out of clean energy subsidies and extended the period of qualification for projects. For PV, the feed-in tariff (FiT) subsidies were extended for three more years until 2023 with an increased budget. Austrian FiT administrative procedures for both wind and solar are often delayed, just like the grid connection process.","Austria has struggled to attract international capital, despite sporting a stable, specialized economy. The country provides a robust framework for private investors, but establishing a new company can be onerous. As in many EU countries, value-added tax (VAT) rates and import duties are not reduced for renewable energy equipment. Another reason for the limited presence of international investors could be attempts by local opponents of wind power to challenge projects by taking advantage of a lack of legal certainty. Further, the state has yet to define protected areas and locations where it is environmentally safe to build renewable projects.","Austria has offered subsidies to promote energy storage investment. One of the aims is to promote a proof-of-concept process to enable small-scale distributed energy resources (DER) to participate in frequency regulation on the grid. Installation requirements for residential rooftop PV systems with storage are inconsistent. Besides that, in response to the energy crisis affecting Europe, the federal government in March approved a €250 million budget package for the deployment of wind and solar energy."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["From 2020 to 2021, the total electric and hybrid car sales in Austria soared from 28,502 to 57,115.

For vehicles with emissions exceeding 275 grams per kilometer, the tax surcharge rose from €20 to €40 per gram of carbon dioxide per kilometer.","Under Austria’s Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP) for 2021 to 2030, the government aims to convene an inter-ministerial process to identify and ultimately remove incentives and subsidies that run counter to decarbonizing the transport sector.

BEVs are also exempt from the Circulation Tax, Standard Consumption Tax, Motor-related Insurance Tax and Benefit In-kind Tax.
