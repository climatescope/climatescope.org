However, with the amendment to the law governing the subsidy of renewable sources of energy in 2022, the government will be able to resume auctions aimed at granting support to renewable energy power plants.","A short-lived renewables boom ended in 2011 when the government imposed a retroactive tax on solar projects to limit returns and lengthen the payback period. Further laws in 2012 and 2013 effectively put a moratorium on further deployment, with renewables additions averaging 30 megawatts a year since then (with 28 megawatts in 2021).","The country had a green tariff program that has been closed to all renewable energy technologies except small hydro since January 2014.

CEZ owns and operates two nuclear power plants, which account for around a third of electricity generation. This share is due to expand over the coming decades because of strong government and public support, a wish to boost energy independence given the country’s reliance on Russian gas, and a need to replace lost capacity through the phase-out of the aging coal fleet, which currently makes up 44% of the installed capacity in the country.
