Some 26% is intended to come from mid- and large-scale hydropower, with the remaining 16% from other renewables. Today, the country generates 60% of its electricity from natural gas, with the remainder generated by hydropower. It has made no progress in its non-hydro renewable energy targets, with the exception of 37 megawatts (MW) of solar projects announced in 2018 and 60MW announced a year later.

Almost 40% of the 2,235MW of installed capacity is provided by three independent gas players, with the remainder from publicly owned hydro and gas. CIE just renewed a concession agreement to run the state-owned generation assets, as well as the transmission and distribution assets, until 2032. Under this agreement, CIE has single-buyer status on the grid, which makes off-site bilateral electricity contracts illegal, but opens the door to mini-grids and on-site power purchase agreements.","Almost 95% of Cote d’Ivoire’s population has access to electricity, up from 58% in 2010. Electrification has progressed under two government programs – the National Program for Rural Electrification (PRONER) and Electricity for All Program (PEPT). PRONER aims to electrify all villages with a population of at least 500 people within 10 kilometers of the main grid by 2020, and to reach full electrification in 2025. To help accomplish full electrification, the US Trade and Development Agency (USTDA) has provided almost $1 million of funding to conduct studies for off-grid solutions in areas far from the grid, expecting a total of 6-8MW of new renewable generation from up to 100 sites.","PEPT focuses on connecting homes near the grid that cannot afford the upfront connection costs, providing them with a financing plan. The program entails an initial fee of 1,000 CFA francs ($1.80) and installments over the next decade to cover the remaining 150,000 CFA francs. As a result, more than 1 million homes have been connected as of March 2021.","Finally, there is the Project to Strengthen the Structures of the Electricity System and Access to Electricity Phase I
