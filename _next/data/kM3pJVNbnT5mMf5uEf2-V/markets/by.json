The Belarus Energy Saving Program set out a modest target for 6% of installed power generation capacity to come from clean energy by 2020. The country fell short of this target, with just 4% renewable power capacity recorded that year. A new goal was laid out in February 2021, aiming for renewables to reach 8% of power generation capacity by 2025.","Belarus uses an annual quota system to advance clean energy build, which sets different technology thresholds. In 2020, the quota was for 6 megawatts (MW) of biogas, 19.8MW of wind, 7MW of hydro, and 1.5MW of wood fuel and other biomass. For 2021, the quotas are 10.47MW for biogas, 35.5MW for wind, 2.5MW for solar PV, and 0.9MW for biomass. Discussions to develop an auction policy date back to 2015. Small-scale industrial users can benefit from a 10-year feed-in tariff.","Belarus offers VAT exemption to clean power projects that are considered official investment projects – meaning developers have signed an investment agreement with Belarus.

Small- and utility-scale solar installations have been picking up since 2015, totaling around 51MW by 2020. There is around 100MW of onshore wind installed.","Belarus has secured a small amount of clean energy investment in the last five years. Small biomass and biofuel investments dominated in the late-2000s, while the most significant deals in the last decade were small hydro investments as well as a large solar deal in 2019. Wind investment has been slowly picking up since 2017.","All segments of the power sector are overseen by vertically integrated state utility BelEnergo. There are six vertically integrated undertakers that perform activities on generation, transmission, distribution, and supply. While the government has stated that it would unbundle the power sector by 2025, no progress has been made so far.

However, there is potential to reduce dependence on imported gas and install renewables. Should the country apply to become a contracting party of the Energy Community – which aims to create an integrated pan-European energy market – this could also bring rules on unbundling the power sector and open up new opportunities.","The state monopoly and weak enabling framework are barriers to clean energy project development. Subsidized power tariffs could pose a further impediment to market access for IPPs. Belarus’s border crisis and imposed sanctions have underscored the country and political risk, which are likely to be ongoing deterrents in the short- to mid-term.
