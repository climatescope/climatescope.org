The current government will not put forward any new policies to drive down emissions and will not adopt a more ambitious 2030 emission reduction target. The Technology Investment Roadmap (TIR), Australia’s flagship long-term clean energy policy announced in 2020, will likely be inadequate for this target as it focuses on future technology cost reductions rather than concrete decarbonization targets. All Australian states have announced net-zero emission targets by 2050, resulting in a complicated patch work of state-based programs to reduce power and transport sector emissions. These programs will continue to support new investment, although they lack the ambition of a comprehensive federal policy."]},{"key":2,"title":"Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)","text":["Australia has committed to a 26-28% reduction on CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030. The country is currently projected to miss this target, unless it uses controversial carbon offsets that factor in the overachievement of the past Kyoto agreement."]},{"key":3,"title":"Fossil fuel phase-out policy","text":["Australia does not have any policies to phase out fossil fuels. There has been a rapid influx of new renewable energy generators, but coal generation still makes up the backbone of electricity provision. However, coal’s share in the power mix is declining as assets age, or are squeezed out of the market by cheaper renewable energy projects. The rising intra-day volatility in spot electricity prices, and a greater need for improved system strength, are signaling the need for more flexible capacity to enter the market. Policy makers and regulators have proposed a series of packages to support additional investment in dispatchable technologies like gas, batteries or pumped hydro. However, many market participants remain wary of a reversion to direct government intervention in a market that has become highly liberalized and privatized."]}]},{"key":2,"title":"Power","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Power policy","text":["Investment in Australian clean energy has seen a boom and bust over the past decade. Small-scale investments, supported by state-based feed-in tariffs and a federal (Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)), have frequently outpaced large-scale assets on an annual basis. Large-scale investment soared to new heights in 2017-18 after years of policy uncertainty, which froze investment but then caused a rush-to-market of companies looking to secure sufficient capacity under the Large-scale Renewable Energy Target (LRET) policy. By 2030, state policies and corporate procurement are expected to increase Australia’s renewable energy supply to more than 50%. Sovereign capital plays a limited but important role in investments, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency seeking to catalyze private capital into clean energy."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Australia’s wholesale electricity markets have been extremely volatile over the past decade. Spot prices were low in 2011, due to an oversupply of generation. What followed was a period of capacity closures, rising fuel prices and failures in transmission assets, which drove average electricity prices to exceed A$150/MWh in some states by 2017. Spot prices have since reduced, following the introduction of a number of policies aimed at bringing down prices, a rapid build-out of new renewable energy generation and a softening in fuel prices (particularly domestic gas and coal). Retail electricity rates paid by households remain high and are often among the highest in OECD countries. This is in part due to expensive network costs, which can make up 40% of a household’s electricity bill."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Australia’s power system is fully liberalized. The country has a competitive power market, as well as an open retail market. Any licensed company is allowed to own generation assets or to sell electricity to consumers. Companies are also permitted to sign power purchase agreements directly with power producers or utilities. Networks are split into transmission and distribution companies, and each is regulated as a monopoly over their jurisdiction. Several market operators and regulators are relied upon to ensure optimum outcomes for consumers, as well as system reliability and security."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Regulatory barriers to invest in Australian power generation remain low. However, recent issues on the grid are making it more challenging to connect large-scale assets on Australia’s East Coast. Policy and market uncertainties have reduced the length and certainty of offtake agreements in recent years, with many new projects now seeking to operate on a quasi-merchant or fully merchant basis. Foreign investors in large and/or key infrastructure projects must proceed through a review process, but to date, this has only resulted in the knock back of planned acquisitions in certain distribution network assets."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["The lack of political support means that Australia lags its peers in electric vehicle uptake. Passenger EV sales accounted for less than 1% of total car sales in 2020. The federal government has done little to provide demand-side or supply-side incentives for Australia’s nascent EV market. There is no federal subsidy for EVs, nor emission standard pushing automakers to make more EVs available. Consumers are subsequently presented with a low range of EV models, while those models that do exist are usually more expensive than their combustion engine counterparts."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["Australia’s flagship transport decarbonization policy, the Future Fuels Strategy (FFS) announced in 2021, lacked a fuel economy standard, EV sales target or any subsidy for low-carbon vehicles.
