For 2030, the country raised the ambition for renewable electricity, aiming for a 70% share.","Greece is in the process of expanding the policy framework to double the share of renewables in electricity generation over the next decade. Increasing interconnection of the country’s island systems can offer growing opportunities for renewables deployment. Greece procures renewables capacity through an auction program that awards a feed-in premium. Since the program was launched in 2018, more than 3.5 gigawatts of wind and solar projects have been awarded. Under the Greek government’s plan that was approved by the European Commission in December 2021, as much as 3GW of renewables will be auctioned over 2022-2025."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["The exposure of the Greek power sector to rising carbon prices and the war in Ukraine has driven the country’s wholesale power prices up. Wholesale prices are also volatile due to highly seasonal demand and fuel price fluctuations. Full liberalization of the power market in line with the European ‘target model’ has been delayed repeatedly but was completed in November 2020.","Retail prices are also at unprecedented levels due to the war in the Ukraine and the fact that ratepayers subsidize higher costs on the non-interconnected island systems. In 2022, the Greek government provided several rounds of electricity subsidies for households and small businesses. The subsidies for August 2022 and September 2022 amounted to 1.1 billion euros and 1.9 billion euros respectively, aiming to absorb at least 89% of the price increases.","In the near-term, Greece plans to tackle the rising power prices through doubling lignite production, expanding the Revithoussa liquefied natural gas (LNG) terminal and building a floating LNG terminal at Alexandroupolis. Growing renewables penetration and increasing island interconnections will also exert downward pressure on power prices."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Onshore wind and utility-scale PV are increasingly competitive with new gas, driving growing interest in renewables development. Competition in auction rounds is heating up and continuing to push prices down. The full market liberalization now allows developers to enter bilateral contracts directly with offtakers. One bilateral corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) has been signed in Greece as of November 2021.","The Greek power system is still dominated by Public Power Corp. (PPC), the former state monopoly that owns the country’s lignite and hydro assets. As part of Greece’s bailout deal with its European creditors, PPC was to sell off 40% of its lignite capacity, but no buyers were found. In September 2019, Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis announced Greece would phase out all lignite production by 2028.","However, following Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, PCC planned to increase lignite production to ensure adequate energy supply fearing potential Russian gas shortages. The response includes ramping up production in all Greece’s operating lignite plants. In addition, a new 660MW lignite power plant will start production in the fall of 2022. It was originally expected to operate on natural gas by 2025. Three new combined-cycle gas turbine plants of around 800 megawatts each are in the pipeline to ensure security of supply.","The transmission system operator is working to extend the grid to the islands, which host some of the best wind and solar sites, with capacity factors for the former reaching 30% in select locations. But highly seasonal power demand on the islands means that development of these sites makes economic sense only if the power can be transported to the mainland. An interconnection between the Peloponnese mainland region and Greece’s largest island, Crete, was commissioned in May 2021. The islands of Skiathos and northern Sporades were connected to the mainland grid in July 2022.

In 2017, the 154-megawatt Kafireas wind farm was delayed for more than six months after a local environmental group challenged the validity of the project's environmental permit.

Subsidies for vehicle charging installations include a 500-euro grant for individuals and tax deductions for companies. A “Green Taxi” EV incentive was also introduced in 2022, with a subsidy of up to 20,000 euros for the replacement of old taxis with EVs.
