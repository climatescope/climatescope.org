The country’s efforts to promote renewables development include tax policies and duty exemptions, but it no longer holds tenders specifically for clean energy contracts. Following legislative changes, state-owned Electric Transmission Company (ETESA) announced in February 2018 that there will be no further tenders specifically to solicit bids from clean energy projects. Instead, all generation sources will compete for contracts. However, ETESA also said technologies will be evaluated based on their environmental attributes and associated costs.","Panama has had tax incentives for the construction, operation and maintenance of clean energy projects since 2004. Renewable generators up to 500 kilowatts (kW) are exempt from all tax on imported equipment as well as VAT. For renewable generators up to 10 megawatts (MW), an income tax credit of up to 25% of the project investment is provided. For generators over 10MW there is a fiscal benefit of 25% and an income tax credit of up to 50% of the project investment. The law also exempts transmission and distribution fees for smaller renewable energy projects up to 10MW, while projects between 10-20MW do not pay transmission or distribution fees for the first 10MW for 10 years.","Further incentives for specific technologies are also available. For example, solar PV related equipment is exempt from import tax and VAT, and qualifies for a tax credit of up to 5% for income tax and accelerated depreciation. Furthermore, equipment, materials and spare parts for wind generation plants are exempt from all international duties, fees, VAT and import tax. Wind project owners are also exempt from national taxes for 15 years.","A net metering policy was instated in 2016, creating the rules to set up self-generation facilities and allowing connection to the distribution grid and the sale of surplus power.
