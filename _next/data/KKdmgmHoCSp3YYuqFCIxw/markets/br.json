The emission level in the base year, 2005, has changed over the NDC updates. It was initially at 2.1 GtCO2e in the first NDC, revised up to 2.8 GtCO2e in 2020 and later reduced to 2.56 GtCO2e in the 2022 update, because of methodological changes in the emissions inventory.","Brazil's NDC covers all sectors. The country’s power sector is relatively clean with only 21% of the generation coming from fossil fuels in 2021. Large hydro is still responsible for over half the total generation in the country."]},{"key":3,"title":"Fossil fuel phase-out policy","text":["There is no fossil fuel phase-out policy in Brazil."]}]},{"key":2,"title":"Power","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Power policy","text":["Since 2009, Brazil has implemented reverse auctions to contract new clean energy generation capacity to supply the regulated utility market. The country is a pioneer of competitive renewable energy auctions, which have led to over 35GW of renewable energy contracted to date. In the May 2022 auction, continuing an established trend, most developers committed not to sell all the generation from their plants via auction but rather 60% of it, on average. They hope to sell the rest at higher prices in Brazil’s free market. In addition, sharp competition among project developers has typically resulted in low average wind and solar prices, including an average solar auction price of $17.5/MWh in July 2019, which remains the lowest recorded in Brazil to date.","Net metering has also been a widely utilized clean energy policy. Retail electricity customers may install up to 5MW self-generation facilities, connect to the grid, deliver surplus generation and obtain compensation in the form of a subsequent billing credit. The incentive has led to a distributed solar boom, with small-scale PV capacity jumping from around zero in 2015 to over 16GW (DC) as of August 2022. Moreover, the new Brazilian net metering and distribution charge law has guaranteed its generous net metering rules will be in place through 2045 for those who have solar systems installed by the end of 2022. New systems installed after that will face a six-year transition period to a new tariff schedule that will gradually pare back compensation."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Retail electricity prices are among the highest in Latin America. However, commercial and industrial (C&I) customers with power demand greater than 500kW are eligible to purchase electricity from Brazil’s deregulated wholesale market. Consumers with demand between 500kW and 1.5MW (special consumers) choosing this option must purchase wholesale power generated from incentivized renewable sources, including wind, small hydro, biomass and solar. The maximum threshold for special consumers fell from 2MW to 1.5MW in January 2020 and will decline by 0.5MW every January until 2023."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Brazil has the largest power market in Latin America, with total installed capacity of around 170GW in 2021. The power sector is fully unbundled. Several distinct actors participate in generation, transmission, distribution and retail. Overall, the power market is fairly evenly split between state-owned and private-sector players. Operador Nacional do Sistema Elétrico (ONS) operates the national power system and Câmara de Comercialização de Energia Elétrica (CCEE) is responsible for the country's wholesale market. Brazil’s matrix remains highly reliant on hydropower and has experienced recurring crises resulting from low rainfall in certain years, most recently in 2020-21. The last crisis has exposed the market to costly fossil-fuel generation, sending power prices soaring and temporarily raising the prospect of electricity rationing. In 2022, the Brazilian government privatized Eletrobras, the biggest electricity company in Latin America, which is responsible for around 30% of the country generation."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Despite Brazil's increasing share of intermittent renewables, most of the generation still comes from hydropower, and there have not been significant grid balancing issues. Brazil's clean energy capacity is largely contracted through auctions, which offer standardized Power Purchase Agreement (PPAs). Brazil regularly holds capacity auctions to ensure grid reliability. There are clear rules and processes defined for interconnection of projects to the grid, as well as regularly updated and published grid expansion plans. Net metering regulation is defined and the efforts to reform it have involved substantial industry and public input. However, hydrogen and storage-specific targets or regulations do not yet exist.","All PPAs are set in local currency, potentially exposing developers to substantial foreign-exchange risk. As the Brazilian real has depreciated significantly in recent years, developers have suffered from lower foreign currency-denominated revenue from long-term contracts and higher costs of imported energy equipment. Rising inflation has prompted Brazil’s central bank to hike the benchmark Selic interest rate for the 12th consecutive time in August 2022, potentially exposing developers to increased borrowing costs."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Brazil’s EV market is growing, but is still at an early stage. As Latin America’s largest auto market, Brazil leads the region in EV sales. Growth has been driven by rising sales of plug-in hybrid electric vehicles, concentrated in the luxury segment, which account for the vast majority of sales. Adoption remains very low as a percentage of new passenger vehicles sales, at well under 1%. All passenger EVs are imported in Brazil. There are currently no large-scale plans to manufacture batteries or vehicles domestically."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["Policy support for EVs is somewhat limited in Brazil. In 2015, import tax rates were lowered from 35% to 0% for battery electric vehicles, and set at a range of 0-7% for plug-in hybrids and hybrids, depending on criteria such as weight and energy efficiency. However, EVs still pay higher IPI (federal excise tax) and ICMS (state sales tax) taxes. In 2018, the annual car ownership tax (IPVA) was set at 4%. EVs are exempt from this in seven states (Ceará, Maranhão, Pernambuco, Piauí, Rio Grande do Norte, Rio Grande do Sul and Sergipe) and enjoy a reduced rate in Mato Grosso do Sul, Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo. Other incentives include exemption from circulation restrictions in Sao Paulo since 2014, which prevent vehicles from entering the city during certain peak hours, depending on the final numbers on their license plates."]},{"key":3,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Electrification of transport has been hampered by a lack of government commitment, high import taxes and opposition from a large and powerful biofuels industry. The country is the second largest producer of biofuels after the US. Around 85% of all new light vehicles sold run on a combination of ethanol and petrol (flex-fuel engines), two thirds of its light passenger fleet is flex-fuel, standard gasoline is 27% blended, and ethanol’s share of light vehicle energy demand hovers near 50%. Diesel has a mandated 10% biodiesel blend. Among the top 10 auto producers globally, Brazil also has a strong domestic auto manufacturing industry that makes flex-fuel vehicles for the national market. Several are pursuing development of ‘flex-fuel engine EVs’ that would integrate biofuels – a relatively unique path globally."]}]},{"key":4,"title":"Buildings","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Buildings market","text":["Brazil's energy efficiency plans have not been well structured overall. The country has established many policies and plans over the past decades, but these have been mainly in reaction to crises rather than the result of structured, long-term planning.
