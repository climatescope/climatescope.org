Until 2017, Finland offered a feed-in premium for wind and various bioenergy technologies.","The government submitted a bill in October 2018 to ban the use of coal for energy, with a draft deadline of May 2029 for most plants. It has agreed to a €90 million ($101 million) investment support scheme for plants that switch from coal before 2025. Domestically mined peat generation – which has similar carbon emissions as lignite – will, however, be slowly phased out only in the 2030s.

This is largely due to a well-functioning, integrated Nordic electricity market with cheap hydroelectricity making up a large share of generation.","Power prices in 2022 have soared in line with prices of other European countries. This has been due to high coal and gas prices, dry weather limiting hydro power generation and delays in commissioning the 1.6 gigawatt Olikluoto 3 nuclear plant."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Finland’s power system is fully liberalized and in line with EU standards. The country has a competitive power market, as well as an open retail market. Any licensed company is allowed to own generation assets or to sell electricity to consumers.","The generation mix is dominated by hydro, nuclear and combined heat and power (CHP) plants. The CHP plants are mainly fueled by biomass and waste, with coal and peat making up a smaller share of the fuel mix. These plants supply Finland’s many district heating networks, as well as the power system. The share of wind generation has grown rapidly, from around 3% in 2015 to 12% in 2020.","Some 141 new wind farms were commissioned in Finland during 2021. Around 1.6 gigawatts (GW) of subsidy-free wind farms are either in the pipeline or newly commissioned, as 14 corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs) have been signed between 2015 and mid-2022. Utility-scale solar has not taken off, but distributed solar capacity reached 400 megawatts (MW) in 2021.

In 2021, close to 100,000 EVs and PHEVs made up 4% of Finland’s vehicle fleet. According to the Finnish ministerial working group, 700,000 EVs are needed on Finland’s roads by 2030 to meet the country’s 2035 carbon neutrality target. However, increased use of biofuels could also help achieve the country’s renewable energy in transport target.","Finland’s tax regime favors low-emission vehicles, as the purchase tax is determined by the CO2 intensity of the vehicle. The purchase tax is charged in addition to value added tax and can be as high as 30% of the purchase price for cars with emissions over 200 grams of CO2 per kilometer. That compares to just 2.7% for BEVs.","There are also subsidies on offer to encourage EV adoption and the installation of chargers. Between 2018 and 2022, private individuals can benefit from a grant of €2,000 when buying a fully electric car. The scheme is set to end in March 2023. Meanwhile, housing associations managing multi-family buildings can receive support for 35% of the installation cost for EV chargers, up to a maximum of €90,000 through the ARA scheme.
