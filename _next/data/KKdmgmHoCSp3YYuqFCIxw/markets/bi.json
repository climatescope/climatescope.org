The country’s rural electrification program is planned mainly around grid extensions and decentralized systems. The country has a specialized Rural Electrification Agency, which aims to plan and develop projects to electrify isolated areas. The only effective support for renewables developers in Burundi is import-tariff exemptions for solar and wind equipment established by the East African Community, of which Burundi is a member. There are no fiscal incentives or other policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs. There are no specific laws discouraging fossil fuels.

Power prices are extremely high, considering the high proportion of hydro, with average tariffs being among the world's highest.

The capital Bujumbura accounts for 95% of electricity consumed. Besides its national generation, Burundi also imports electricity from neighboring countries – Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda – through a cross-border hydropower complex. The power sector continues to be dominated by Regideso, which has a monopoly on electricity transmission, distribution, and supply. Transmission, distribution, and generation infrastructure is old and needs modernization and investment.","The Burundi government recently finalized a power sector “master plan” which estimated an investment requirement of $661 million over the next five years to boost electricity access to 30% by 2030."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies heavily on foreign aid. The country has been plagued by civil wars and political tension for decades. It is ranked 166th among 190 countries in the World’s Bank Doing Business index for 2021. Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure, trade barriers, high taxes and low access to credit are among the challenges for businesses. On the positive side, Burundi joined the East African Community in 2007 and started the implementation of a common external tariff in 2009. Burundi also embarked on major reforms to improve the procedure for creating a new business. The relationship with the East African Community could be a good opportunity for Burundi to participate in regional infrastructure projects, such as interconnection links and shared hydro power plants.","The country has faced difficulties attracting investment for energy infrastructure due to political instability and conflicts. The legal framework requires updating to attract private sector participation. The economic and political instability of the country has also affected human capital and the development of a skilled workforce.
