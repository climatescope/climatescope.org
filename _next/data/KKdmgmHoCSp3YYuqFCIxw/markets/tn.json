Two separate auction regimes – the authorization for smaller projects and concession for larger projects – are the main instruments to achieve these objectives. Under the authorization regime, the government contracted 64 megawatts (MW) of photovoltaic capacity in 2017, 70MW in 2018 and a further 70MW in 2020. Under the concession regime, Tunisia announced in 2018 that it will contract another 500MW of wind plants, and contracted 500MW of PV in 2019.","Project deadlines vary between the first half of 2021 and end of 2022, and the winners will secure a 20-year power purchase agreement (PPA) with the state-owned utility Tunisia Company of Electricity and Gas, known as STEG.

However, the power mix is due to become more diversified over the next few years as auctions are set to increase the country’s clean energy capacity.","State-owned utility STEG controls over 80% of Tunisia’s power generation and has a monopoly over the transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas. Independent power producers are allowed in the market under the concession and authorization programs and can rely on a 20-year standardized PPA with STEG.

It is one of few countries in Africa with a nearly 100% electrification rate.","Recent political instability and the 2015 law that allowed IPPs in the market are the main barriers for international investors.
