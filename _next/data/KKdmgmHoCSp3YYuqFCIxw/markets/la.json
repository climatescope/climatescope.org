It is aiming for a 60% decrease in greenhouse gas emissions by 2030 versus a business-as-usual scenario from 2000 levels, equal to 62,000 kilotons of CO2 equivalent (ktCO2e). The target covers the “land use, land use change and forestry” (LULUCF) and energy sectors with specific average emissions abatement targets between 2020 and 2030. The LULUCF sector has an annual mitigation target of 1,100ktCO2e, while the energy sector is split among three sub-sectors: hydropower (2,500ktCO2e per year), energy efficiency (50ktCO2e per year) and transport (325ktCO2e per year).","Laos says that it could lower its emissions further if it were to receive financial assistance from developed countries. For example, the LULUCF sector could target the mitigation of 45,000ktCO2e per year between 2020 and 2030 by increasing forestry to cover 70% of the country’s land area. Laos estimates that it would require more than $4.7 billion in financial support for its conditional mitigation measures that also include the agriculture and waste sectors."]},{"key":3,"title":"Fossil fuel phase-out policy","text":["There is no fossil fuel phase-out policy in Laos."]}]},{"key":2,"title":"Power","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"Power policy","text":["Laos likes to pitch itself as the “battery of Asia”, eager to capitalize on its abundant hydroelectric resources and small population to export energy to its larger, fast-growing neighbors. Accordingly, it has focused its attention on building large hydro power plants that, in many cases, send power directly across its borders to Thailand or Vietnam.","The government is targeting a 30% share for non-large hydro renewable consumption in the power mix by 2025. EDL-Gen Solar Power Company was established in 2015 with the aim of building 100 megawatts (MW) of solar in Laos. A 40MW solar tender is expected to be announced in partnership with the US Agency for International Development (USAID)."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Power prices in Laos are relatively low, due to the abundance of low-cost hydroelectricity. The government sets electricity tariffs and subsidizes industry, small residential consumers, agriculture, and small- and medium-sized enterprises with rates below the cost of service. Banks and hotels, on the other hand, have to pay significantly higher tariffs, which can make onsite solar competitive despite the absence of net metering or other incentives.","Rates remained stable through 2020-2021. In March 2020, the government approved a proposal to gradually increase electricity prices from 2020 to 2025. However, from April 2020 to February 2021, a subsidy policy was introduced for those who use between 151 and 461 kilowatt-hours (kWh) per month, due to the pandemic. The subsidy was suspended from March 2021 causing prices to rise in the local currency, the Lao kip. However, rates in US dollars have decreased by 8% on average for residential, commercial and industrial customers due to the devaluation of the Lao kip."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The domestic power market in Laos has a single-buyer structure, with Electricite du Laos (EDL) being the sole buyer and retailer, as well as the grid operator. Power generation was partially liberalized in 2010, when EDL spun off its large hydro assets under EDL-Gen, in which it owns around a 75% stake. Independent power producers are also active in the market. They have been responsible for roughly 90% of capacity additions since 2015.","The pace of capacity additions picked up rapidly from 2013 onwards, due to external demands. Thailand’s state-owned Electricity Generating Authority of Thailand (EGAT) financed, contracted, and now dispatches power from several new large hydro projects and a 2 gigawatt (GW) coal plant. External demands will keep driving new capacity additions, as Laos is planning to double its transmission capacity with neighbors Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia, and Myanmar over the next few years.","Investment reached $200 million from 2011-2020, and then peaked in 2021 with $1.5 billion for a 600MW capacity wind project."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Power demand in Laos has surged as it has extended its electric grid to the countryside. Peak load doubled between 2010-2018, reaching over 1,000 megawatt-peak (MWp) from 2019 to 2021, and peaking in 2021 at 1,276MWp. Overall generation (much of which is exported) quadrupled over the same time frame.","Laos aims to reach 98% household electrification by 2025. It is well on its way, according to official statistics, reaching 97% in 2018, compared to only 15% in 1995. Concerns remain, however, on the quality of the power supply to rural areas, and many speculate that the true electrification rate remains around 70-80%. Off-grid systems are an option for the remaining households, but the remoteness of these homes means that income-generating opportunities – and therefore the ability to pay for solar home systems – remain limited. Most solar home systems to date have effectively been financed through grants.","The power market in Laos is oversupplied with carbon-free hydroelectricity, leaving little incentive for the government or local companies to invest in non-hydro clean energy technologies. The bulk of recent power sector investment – in large hydroelectric facilities and a single coal-fired plant – has been financed by Thailand and Vietnam for their own consumption. China, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam are dominant players in the market. There is little to no domestic concessional financing available, and few banks in the country have the capacity to finance power projects.","A dam collapse in 2018 temporarily put under-construction hydro plants on hold while the government investigated the incident. Work resumed in September 2018. An estimated 1GW of hydropower is under development as of 2022, and no priority has been given to other renewables technologies, such as solar.","Meanwhile, offtaker risk remains a significant obstacle to new projects of all types. Projects with EDL as the offtaker are not considered bankable due to the utility’s financial difficulties. Projects for the Thai market have been more successful because EGAT, Thailand’s utility, is considered a credit-worthy offtaker. However, as EGAT’s supply has slowly caught up with electricity demand, its interest in projects in Laos has leveled off. This means many new projects will likely have EDL or Vietnam’s utility, EVN, as offtaker, which will make financing more difficult. Other barriers include hydro overcapacity and a shift in focus to fossil fuels as Laos struggles with rising prices."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Laos’s NDC includes a target for electric vehicles (EVs) to comprise 30% of its national two-wheeler and passenger car fleet by 2030, while also having biofuels meet 10% of transportation fuel demand.
