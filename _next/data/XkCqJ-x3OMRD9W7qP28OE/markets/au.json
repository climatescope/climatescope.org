The recently elected Labor government has introduced and is in the process of legislating a reduction in carbon emissions by 43% below 2005 levels by 2030 and a reduction to net zero by 2050. Building on the Technology Investment Roadmap (TIR), Australia’s flagship long-term clean energy policy announced in 2020, the government has introduced their ‘Powering Australia’ plan which aims to increase clean energy penetration, support electric vehicle uptake, amend the safeguard mechanism, support industry decarbonization and provide funding for transmission and grid upgrades.

Targets, funding, and ambition differ by state, resulting in a complicated patchwork of state-based programs to reduce power and transport sector emissions. Many states have ambitious targets and are driving significant change through the announcement of their Renewable Energy Zones (REZs) and renewable energy auction programs.","Australia had committed to a 26-28% reduction on CO2 emissions from 2005 levels by 2030 and is now in the process of raising this to 43%.

There has been a rapid influx of new renewable energy generators, but coal generation still makes up the backbone of electricity provision. However, coal’s share in the power mix is declining as assets age, or are squeezed out of the market by cheaper renewable energy projects.

Investment in Australian clean energy has seen a boom and bust over the past decade, with investment in utility-scale renewables stagnating after its high in 2018. A lack of clear, long-term government policy and an increasingly hostile power market have deterred new investment. However, since the inauguration of the new government, more ambitious federal targets, and ongoing support from state governments, investment is picking up. Small-scale investments, supported by state-based feed-in tariffs and a federal (Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme (SRES)), have frequently outpaced large-scale assets on an annual basis. Sovereign capital plays a limited but important role in investments, with the Clean Energy Finance Corporation and the Australian Renewable Energy Agency seeking to catalyze private capital into clean energy."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Australia’s wholesale electricity market has been extremely volatile over the past decade, and faced an unprecedented, chaotic start in 2022. Abnormally high power prices triggered price caps in the country’s wholesale power markets in June 2022, leading to a historical suspension of the whole system. Wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity Market (NEM) rose an average of A$232-351/MWh in May 2022, an increase of 147-406% year-on-year.","As a result of soaring wholesale costs, the market regulator has signaled that electricity retail  tariffs will rise. The default market rate (DMO), the benchmark rate for tariffs offered by retailers, will rise by 7.2-18.3% in 2022-23.  Retail electricity rates paid by households remain high and are often among the highest in OECD countries. This is in part due to expensive network costs, which can make up 40% of a household’s electricity bill."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Australia’s power system is fully liberalized. The country has a competitive power market, as well as an open retail market. Any licensed company is allowed to own generation assets or to sell electricity to consumers. Companies are also permitted to sign power purchase agreements directly with power producers or utilities. Networks are split into transmission and distribution companies, and each is regulated as a monopoly over their jurisdiction. Several market operators and regulators are relied upon to ensure optimum outcomes for consumers, as well as system reliability and security. However, high power prices have resulted in tough conditions for Australia’s competitive retail energy market. Many energy retailers have already failed, and more are expected to follow."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Regulatory barriers to invest in Australian power generation remain low. However, recent issues on the grid are making it more challenging to connect large-scale assets on the east coast.
