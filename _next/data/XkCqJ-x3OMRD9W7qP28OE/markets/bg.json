Under Bulgaria’s NECP, the country is aiming for renewables to account for 27% of gross final energy consumption by 2030, up from 20% in 2020.","As of July 2018, feed-in tariff contracts for renewable energy producers with at least 4 megawatts (MW) of capacity are no longer being offered. Other renewable energy producers that were getting feed-in tariffs have been offered feed-in premium contracts instead which, unlike feed-in tariffs, are based on market prices. In 2021, record-high electricity prices led to a zero premium for renewable energy producers and a moratorium on the regulated market.","Renewable electricity producers with a capacity below 4MW and feed-in tariff contracts in place prior to July 2018 – as well as new rooftop or facade photovoltaic installations with a maximum installed capacity of 30 kilowatts, and certain installations using combined cycle and indirect use of biomass – are still eligible for a feed-in tariff.","As part of the ongoing reform of Bulgaria’s energy sector, the parliament’s Energy Commission filed a new bill for amending and supplementing the Energy Act in November 2020. It continues the policy of pursuing full liberalization of the wholesale energy market and integration of the national market into the common European energy market. The bill proposes two main changes: the replacement of cold reserve transactions with auctions, and the conclusion of feed-in premium agreements for renewable producers with a total installed capacity of between 0.5MW and 1MW.

There is a taxation scheme applied to the revenue of renewables generation in Bulgaria, with 5% of producers’ revenues being directed toward subsidizing energy prices for end users.","Bulgaria’s wholesale power exchange went live in 2016, but sales volumes have remained below 25% of final electricity consumption. Since October 2020, all non-residential customers have been purchasing their electricity through the free market but state utility NEK is still the industry's default supplier.","The government's decision to switch existing renewables and other regulated generation to a contract-for-difference remuneration system aims to increase liquidity in the market."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The share of renewables in Bulgaria’s total power mix has doubled over the past decade and currently sits at 20%. This reflects a generous feed-in tariff that fueled a solar investment boom.

Liberalization and unbundling reforms rolled out since 2010 have opened up the generation, distribution and retail sector to only limited levels of competition.","Despite the legal unbundling of the three distribution system operators, there is no real competition in the distribution market. There is only one licensed supplier in each geographical region. Meanwhile, investment company Bulgaria Energy Holding (BEH) owns both transmission and generation capacity.","The Independent Bulgarian Energy Exchange (IBEX) was sold by BEH to the Bulgarian Stock Exchange in 2018. All electricity produced in the country is sold through IBEX. The wholesale market operates on a non-discriminatory basis, but the transmission system operator, known as the Electricity System Operator (ESO), can refuse to purchase or transmit renewable electricity if there is no grid capacity, or if it could compromise grid stability.","Corporate power purchase agreements are allowed in Bulgaria, but a small and fragmented market means it is not easy to find large offtakers. The electricity distribution companies and the transmission system operator are not obliged to buy back renewables.","The Bulgarian electricity market is currently in transition with the support of the EU Commission and development banks, but nuclear power is expected to remain dominant. Construction of the Kozloduy nuclear power plant could provide a significant opportunity for investment, although the government is gradually decreasing its coal power capacity to replace it with renewables.","This has put pressure on retail prices and attracted international investors such as CEZ from the Czech Republic.

The country has not recorded any significant volumes of clean energy asset finance since this intervention. Meanwhile, changes to the feed-in tariff scheme through the addition of fees also damaged investor confidence. In addition, Bulgaria lacks strong national, commercial and industrial offtakers for renewables projects.","Domestic policy has focused on adding new small hydro capacity, but Bulgaria’s damaged ecosystem is unlikely to be able to support the volume of small hydro projects that have already received permits.

The plan also envisages energy efficiency improvements decreasing the amount of energy used for heating and cooling by 2% across 2020-2030.","Renovating the building stock is a key element of the country’s strategy to boost energy efficiency.

Priority will be given to introducing more efficient heating and cooling systems.","The country says that both EU and other funding programs will be used to finance its energy efficiency initiatives. For example, the Energy Efficiency and Renewable Sources Fund is the Bulgarian government’s soft loan program for fossil-fuel powered and renewable energy heating systems. It covers new high-efficiency boilers, separate domestic hot water heaters for summer usage, and high-efficiency fossil-fuel or electric-powered heat pumps – among other things. There is also a local-level grant scheme for renewable energy heating systems as part of the “Bulgarian Municipalities Working Together to Improve Air Quality” project, which runs to 2024.","There are also tax breaks on offer.
