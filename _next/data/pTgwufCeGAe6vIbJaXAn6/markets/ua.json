Projects awarded feed-in tariffs must commission by the end of 2021 for solar projects and by the end of 2022 for wind energy projects. In July 2020, feed-in tariffs for projects commissioned before this date were retroactively cut by 2.5-15%, depending on the project technology and size.","Ukraine’s Electricity Law, which came into full effect in July 2019, established a framework meant to support continued growth of renewables through a tender/auction program, but auctions have been delayed.

New market rules have not brought full liberalization, however, as some state-owned power is price-capped to keep residential electricity tariffs low. The wholesale market is still heavily concentrated, and dominated by fossil fuel plants owned by DTEK. To avoid excessive volatility, the wholesale market is operated with price caps. Both thermal and nuclear plants need investment for renewal and life extension. It is unclear how this will be funded and how retail prices will change if and when price caps are lifted. Ukraine’s situation is further complicated by a shortfall in coal supplies from the east of the country, which has been destabilized by conflict with Russia. Coal imports have partially compensated for this, while some plants are retrofitting to run on gas instead."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["The new electricity law liberalized the power market, clarified the offtaker’s role and established a framework for standardized power purchase agreements. This boosted investor confidence, which had been undermined by political instability over the past decade and territorial conflict with Russia.","The new power market structure will require further price liberalization to incentivize independent power producers to enter the market. Generation is only partially privatized, and DTEK is by far the largest single player.","Nuclear plants supplied more than half the electricity generated in Ukraine in 2020 – a proportion that has remained fairly stable since 2015. Non-hydro renewables accounted for around 7% of generation in 2020, and this share has doubled since 2019."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Regulatory and legislative reforms spurred a boom in clean energy financing in Ukraine over 2018 and 2019, with more than $5 billion invested. The biggest single investment so far has been by Norwegian wind developer NBT, with a $210 million loan for the first phase of the Syvash wind project. Local developers, led by Ukraine’s largest non-state utility, DTEK, have played a large role in the development of the sector. European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has gone to great lengths to present Ukraine as lower risk than previously perceived. Cuts to the feed-in tariff, which is backed by a sovereign guarantee, are likely to undermine this confidence, though smaller levels of investment may still be possible for projects that have secured feed-in tariffs, albeit at lower levels than expected.","Power demand in Ukraine fell after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukrainian Crimea. Ongoing militarization of eastern Ukraine has led to major economic volatility and a longer term slowdown. Demand has revived somewhat since 2016, as parts of the country have stabilized and returned to growth. The current generation fleet has been adequate to serve the national market, but Soviet-era nuclear assets must either be upgraded or replaced. The aim is to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas for its power and heating needs. Wind and solar resources are attractive, but the distribution and transmission system will require major investment to integrate growing renewables capacity.","There are restrictions on the use of agricultural land for renewables projects and on the production of bioethanol by foreign companies. There also are untested rules around the ownership of strategically important energy assets by foreign companies. Probably of greater concern are risk perceptions. Political fears subsided after national elections in early 2019 took place with relative transparency and uncontested results. The retroactive cuts to feed-in tariffs, introduced in 2020, were based on a Memorandum of Understanding with local renewable energy associations but faced opposition from many power producers. The country still ranks poorly in international corruption assessments. Currency fluctuations have been a barrier to renewables deployment, though the feed-in tariff was linked to the euro to circumvent this issue. The administrative burden on foreign companies remains onerous."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Electric vehicles, including plug-in hybrids, made up 4% of passenger vehicle sales in 2020.

This creates issues for EV owners because even though the number and availability of charging stations has increased greatly, the quality of charge they deliver can be low, and can even damage the EV in the long term. Additionally, it can be difficult to find sites with electricity of the proper voltage to install effective charging points, as government restrictions on the siting of charging points across main roads has limited the space available for them in the past.

Ukrainian residential energy use dropped by 22% over 2010 to 2018. The 2020 energy efficiency targets were achieved, partly due to economic recessions and loss of territory during the conflict with Russia.","An updated NEEAP is currently under development, which should provide a roadmap out to 2030. Energy efficiency improvements are of strategic importance, to reduce the reliance on imported natural gas.","There is some support for energy efficiency improvements in buildings.
