The government also aims to install 1 million rooftop PV systems by 2030 under its “#mission2030” initiatives. Renewables are supported through feed-in tariffs and upfront capital grants in the case of small hydro and solar projects, although the government is drafting a new energy law to transition to a premium-based auction system. Originally due by 2021, the final law now looks more likely to be in place in 2022.","Austrian law sets priority dispatch for renewable energy projects over other, non-renewable sources to meet the grid’s demands.","The country has had an energy storage subsidy in place since October 2019. An amendment to the Green Electricity Act provides up to EUR 12 million in subsidies for storage systems for three years with a limit of 50kWh per plant."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Austria’s wholesale power prices are lower than most of its neighbors due mainly to an abundance of large hydroelectric generation.

Other renewables – mainly rooftop PV and onshore wind – have grown from a low base over the last decade to reach over 1GW. The power sector has been partly unbundled and liberalized, but the state retains a central role. Publicly-owned players are the foremost owners of renewables capacity, with Land Burgenland and Verbund topping the list. All segments of the country’s power sector are open to private participation with the exception of transmission. To date, companies have signed few bilateral power-purchase agreements with clean energy projects, partly due to the availability of cheap hydropower. Renewable electricity is purchased as a country obligation in Austria.","Austria has some lithium-ion battery production facilities online, including factories owned by Samsung and BMZ."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Austrian electricity demand is rising gradually, but growth is unlikely to accelerate without expanded efforts to electrify the country’s heating, industry and transportation sectors.

Adding to the uncertainty, investors currently have little visibility on how the framework will ultimately work. With the arrival of Covid, policy-makers delayed the phase-out of clean energy subsidies and extended the period of qualification for projects.","Austria has struggled to attract international capital, despite sporting a stable, specialized economy. The country provides a robust framework for private investors, but establishing a new company can be onerous. As in many EU countries, VAT rates and import duties are not reduced for renewables equipment.","Austria has offered subsidies to promote energy storage investment.

For vehicles with emissions exceeding 275 g/km, the tax surcharge rose from EUR 20 to EUR 40 per gram of CO2/km.","Under Austria’s Integrated National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the government is to convene an inter-ministerial process to identify and ultimately remove incentives and subsidies that run counter to de-carbonizing the transport sector.
