The country seeks to have clean sources account for 45% of final energy consumption by 2030. To achieve that, it held a reverse auction for clean power deliver contracts in September 2019. Under that tender, a 75MW wind farm was awarded a zero-subsidy contract and dispatch priority. The auction scheme will continue through 2022 with a total budget of 385 million euros ($20 million). Upcoming plans include auctions for offshore wind power delivery contracts in 2023.","Lithuania has ambitious plans for what it calls 'prosumers'.

Still, retail prices in the country remain relatively low compared to elsewhere in the EU due to the national government’s close regulation. Lithuania is now in the process of implementing a phase-out of price regulation, potentially opening the market to greater competition and choice for consumers.","This is just one of the three major transitions the country’s electricity sector is undertaking, however. Lithuania seeks also to reduce import dependency and increase interconnectivity and synchronization with the European network. New power interconnections with Poland and Sweden are planned for 2023 and could affect price dynamics. This should help Lithuania balance and integrate higher volumes of intermittent renewable generation.","Lithuania has implemented generous investment incentives to convince consumers to install renewable power systems."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["In 2020, renewables accounted for a quarter of Lithuania’s power-generating capacity. Almost half of that was wind or biomass & waste.","Distributed solar is available to residents of apartment blocks through a remote purchasing scheme created under the ‘Solar Community’ online platform in March 2020. Plans for offshore wind are progressing with a site in the Baltic Sea that could support 700MW of capacity having been selected and scheduled for development in 2023.","Lithuania attracted around $1.2 billion of clean energy investment from 2010 through 2020. Wind accounted for almost half the total, although from 2016-2017, biomass dominated, attracting $621 million. Lithuania's top lead arranger for renewables has been the European Investment Bank, which has deployed $204 million, around a third of the country’s total. EIB’s involvement has helped to reduce interest rates for financing renewables, energy efficiency, clean transport, and pollution prevention and control. Lithuania’s first large subsidy-free wind farm of 69MW secured financing from GE Capital and E Energija in August 2020.","Lithuania’s electricity market remains highly concentrated, despite a large number of licensed suppliers.

Renewable energy auctions should help capacity build through 2025. As retail electricity prices are low, customers have less motivation to install residential solar systems compared to in other countries, but a rebate scheme set to run through 2023 could spur activity. The goal of synchronization with the European grid by 2025 remains a challenge.","Lithuania’s renewable energy auction scheme got off to a strong start but has lost momentum recently. An auction held in 2020 received less than three bids compared to seven in the earlier auction. Separately, auctions for premiums up to 3.02 euros were undersubscribed and the quota was instead moved to later auctions. Government officials say results demonstrate that current electricity prices and power plant installation costs are enough to spur market activity without state incentives.","Auctions for balancing electricity are held by state grid authority LITGRID with suppliers of balancing energy and TSOs from other countries."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Demand for internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles rose by a modest 1.9% from 2018-2019 in Lithuania.
