As part of its National Energy and Climate Plan (NECP), the country is targeting 80% of electricity generation from renewables in 2030, and also aims to reach a 47% share of renewables in final energy consumption, up from 31% in 2020.","Portugal has set technology-specific renewables capacity targets for 2030 in its latest NECP to guide the expansion of renewables. It aims to increase its solar and wind capacity to 19 gigawatts (GW) by 2030, from 7GW in 2019.","Portugal is striving towards increasing interconnection with the rest of Europe and has set ambitious goals for clean hydrogen.

However, the scheme's suspension ended growth. The government's support program for underdeveloped technologies has a maximum award of 5 million euros ($5.82 million) per developer – too small for offshore wind projects. However, the government is helping to provide a grid connection for a floating offshore wind platform.","Portugal launched its first utility-scale renewable energy tenders in 2019 to accelerate progress towards its target of installing 7 gigawatts (GW) of new solar PV capacity by 2030. The first round for 1.4GW of PV injection capacity was held in July 2019.
