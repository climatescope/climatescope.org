It is looking to reduce emissions by 22% by 2030 compared to a business-as-usual scenario, with estimated emissions of 77.3 million metric tons of CO2 equivalent a year in 2030. As a part of this goal, it seeks to raise renewable electricity generation capacity from 729 megawatts in 2013 to at least 3,200 megawatts by 2030 and to reverse deforestation by increasing forest cover from approximately 14% in 2013 to 21% in 2030 through forest protection. It also plans to increase wetland coverage from 10.9% in 2014 to 12% by 2030. Total emissions in 2000, including land use and land use change and foresty, or LULUCF, were estimated at 36.5 MtCO2eq/yr and emissions are projected to rise to approximately 77.3 MtCO2e/a in 2030. Full implementation is conditional on the support of the international community.","Uganda submitted an updated NDC on October 12, 2021. The updated NDC changed the base year to 2015 and the reference period to 2021-30, but the BAU target year remained 2030.

The country has achieved its renewable energy generation capacity targets for all technologies except for large hydro (855 megawatts against a target of 1,200 megawatts) and geothermal (zero against a target of 45 megawatts). The country generates more than 90% of its power from renewable sources, including large hydro and biomass and has 1,160 megawatts of renewables connected to the grid. Uganda generates more than 90% of its power from renewable sources, including large hydro.","Uganda’s highly successful Global Energy Transfer feed-in tariff (GET FiT) program launched in 2014, becoming the first competitive auction program for renewables in East Africa. The program successfully procured 20 megawatts of solar and more than 100 megawatts of small hydro projects. With GET FiT, Uganda became the first Sub-Saharan African country outside of South Africa to implement competitive auctions for renewables. However, there is no auction program in force at the moment and none are planned, as the country has significant overcapacity."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Uganda has relatively high retail power prices compared to neighboring countries. This is largely due to the combination of cost overruns and expensive take-or-pay contracts with renewable (mostly large-scale hydro) projects. Umeme, the country’s transmission and distribution utility, guarantees shareholders a 20% return on investment, further boosting prices. Residential, industrial and commercial rates have all increased more than 50% in real terms since 2010."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Uganda began unbundling its power market at the turn of the century, splitting up the utility’s generation, distribution and transmission arms. So far, more than ten different independent power producers (IPPs) have commissioned projects on the grid. They compete alongside the state developer, Uganda Electricity Generation Co. (UEGCL). The country's transmission remains under state monopoly, with the Uganda Electricity Transmission Co. (UETCL) being the sole operator of the system. Distribution is liberalized, with Uganda Electricity Distribution Co. (UEDCL) licensing eight different electricity distribution companies. However, Umeme controls almost all of the retail electricity sales on the grid via a concession with UEDCL. Concessions are granted to other distributors in areas of the country outside of Umeme’s concession as sole providers of electricity in these regions. Customers cannot choose from whom to purchase electricity. The Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA) oversees all three segments of the power sector.","Uganda continues to develop its abundant hydro resources, pushing the power sector further down a low-carbon trajectory. The country's outlook for procuring other renewables, such as wind and solar, is more mixed. Uganda’s successful feed-in tariff program led to development of the region's largest solar projects outside of South Africa, however, government decisions to contract several massive hydro projects have raised concern about oversupply and damped prospects for future wind and solar procurement. The 600-megawatt Karuma hydro project is expected online in 2022, and some of the country's oldest power plants have undergone retrofits in recent years."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Offtakers are generally secure in receiving payments for contracted power. The transmission system operator, UETCL, is the sole offtaker for all grid-connected power in the country. Grid-connected projects to date have signed 'deemed energy' (take-or-pay) contracts, and UETCL's commitments are understood to be backstopped by the Ministry of Finance. As long as projects are delivering to UETCL at the designated delivery point, they are paid whether or not UETCL is able to evacuate the power. This has increased the ability of projects to secure finance and boosted their profitability.","Official investment and policy are expected to focus on expanding access via off-grid generation, as well as transmission and distribution infrastructure, rather than on growing renewable capacity. There are plans to develop a comprehensive legal, regulatory and commercial framework for mini-grids, as well as a net metering framework for rooftop solar.","Uganda has a thriving off-grid solar industry, with many companies using pay-as-you-go and mobile money applications to power strong growth. Most of Uganda's energy access initiatives are focused on rural electrification, as a large portion of the country's capital, Kampala, already has grid access. The national electrification rate is low at 28%, while the rural electrification rate stands at just 8%. The country has introduced various strategies and plans with universal access targets that range from 2030 to 2040."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["Uganda’s EV market remains at a very early stage."]},{"key":2,"title":"EV policy","text":["Uganda does not have an explicit clean transport target, however, the country has aspirations as an automobile producer, both conventional and electric.

Construction on the Kiira Vehicle plant began in February 2019, and it is expected to be operational by year-end. Kiira receives technological support from China’s state-owned China Hi-Tech Group Corp.

For this reason, Uganda is seeking to tighten restrictions around the age of imported vehicles, either via taxation with rates that increase with vehicle age or via outright bans. Uganda amended its Traffic and Road Safety Act to attempt to ban the import of old cars on environmental grounds, as well as to protect its nascent domestic auto industry.","Uganda first introduced such taxes in 2009 by applying a 20% tax on cars older than eight years, and in 2018 it banned importing cars older than 15 years.
