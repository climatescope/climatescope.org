The country does not currently offer any support mechanisms for new renewables projects. The possibility of auctions has been under discussion for several years, and the Czech Republic is one of the last EU member states that has yet to initiate such a program. A short-lived renewables boom ended in 2011 when the government imposed a retroactive tax on solar projects to limit returns and lengthen the payback period. Further laws in 2012-13 effectively put a moratorium on further deployment, with renewables additions averaging 30 megawatts a year since then. The country had a green tariff program that has been closed to all renewables technologies except small hydro since January 2014.","Nevertheless, the Czech Republic achieved its 2020 target for renewables to comprise 13% of final energy consumption seven years ahead of schedule, which affirms that the original goal was not very ambitious. For 2030, the country is aiming for renewables to account for 22% of final energy consumption, which is below the European Commission’s recommendation of at least 23%.","Concerns about energy independence have dominated discussions about phasing out coal, as the fossil fuel is a source of dispatchable generation capacity in the Czech Republic. The country is also highly dependent on imported crude oil and gas, with almost all of its imported gas coming from Russia. The EU emissions trading system (EU ETS) increases fossil fuel prices in the Czech Republic and an excise tax applies to oil products, natural gas, and coal consumption."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Retail prices for all types of customers are relatively lower than surrounding EU countries, suggesting there is little impetus for households to install small-scale solar PV or corporates to undertake power purchase agreements (PPAs).

CEZ is the biggest renewables asset owner in the country. Both CEZ and transmission system operator (TSO) CEPS are likely to remain government-owned for the foreseeable future.","CEZ owns and operates two nuclear power plants, which account for around a third of electricity generation. This share is due to expand over the coming decades due to strong government and public support, a wish to boost energy independence amid reliance on Russian gas, and a need to replace lost capacity through the phase-out of the aging coal fleet. Potential challenges will be deciding how to finance new reactors and mitigating anti-nuclear pressure from some of the country’s EU neighbors. Still, the Czech Republic’s generation mix is likely to remain diversified as the national strategy does not allow any one technology to provide more than 65% of generation."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Onshore wind potential is limited by land availability and public acceptance issues.
