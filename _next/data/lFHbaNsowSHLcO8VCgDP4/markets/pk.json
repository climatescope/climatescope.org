Pakistan is looking for 60% of all energy produced in the country to come from renewables by 2030 and for 30% of all new vehicles sold to be electric. Meanwhile, a moratorium on new coal plants was introduced in 2020 and coal imports have been banned.

This is being achieved through policies such as feed-in-tariffs and net metering, and around 57 megawatts has been added through its net metering policy.
