Full liberalization of the power market in line with the European ‘target model’ has been delayed repeatedly but was completed in November 2020.

Competition in auction rounds is heating up and continuing to push prices down. The full market liberalization also now allows developers to enter bilateral contracts directly with offtakers. One bilateral corporate power purchase agreement (PPA) has been signed in Greece as of November 2021.","The Greek power system is still dominated by Public Power Corp. (PPC), the former state monopoly that owns the country’s lignite and hydro assets. As part of Greece’s bailout deal with its European creditors, PPC was to sell off 40% of its lignite capacity, but no buyers were found and in September 2019 the prime minister announced Greece would phase out all lignite production by 2028, with all but one plant to close by 2023. A flexibility mechanism to reward ramping capacity is under discussion, and at least two new combined-cycle gas turbine plants of around 800 megawatts each are in the works to ensure security of supply as lignite – which made up a quarter of generation in 2019 – leaves the system.","The transmission system operator is working to extend the grid to the islands, which host some of the best wind and solar sites, with capacity factors for the former reaching 30% in some locations. But highly seasonal power demand on the islands means that development of these sites makes economic sense only if the power can be transported to the mainland.
