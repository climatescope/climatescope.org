Successive reforms have failed to resolve the GC oversupply.","New policies have been established to support the 2030 renewable electricity target of 49.4%. In June 2018, Romania’s parliament approved the introduction of a net-metering scheme for small-scale renewables up to 100kW, which allows individuals to deduct the power they produce from their electricity bill. Residential solar is also supported through the “Casa Verde” grant program that finally kicked off in September 2020 following administrative delays. For utility-scale projects, Romania adopted regulations allowing corporate power purchase agreements for projects built after June 2020. An auction scheme starting in 2022 or 2023 is under discussion.","Romania has announced a coal phase-out target for 2032. The declining economics of Romanian coal plants was likely a deciding factor when setting the target. The carbon price under the European Emissions Trading Scheme has become a heavy financial burden for Romania’s main lignite power producer, CE Oltenia. In 2020, the company was unable to pay for its emissions allowances and was granted a rescue loan by the Romanian state.
