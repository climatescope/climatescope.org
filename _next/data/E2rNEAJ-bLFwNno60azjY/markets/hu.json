The METAR tenders have allocated almost 1 gigawatt of renewable energy capacity, mainly solar PV, over 2019-2022.","Another new support program was introduced in 2017, allowing new renewable projects of 0.5-1 megawatt to receive a feed-in premium and sell on the wholesale market. Projects between 50 kilowatts and 0.5 megawatts are still eligible for the KAT feed-in tariff, but PV applications for this category ended in May 2018.","Wind power is not eligible for the METAR feed-in premium, and restrictions on building locations make support for wind very unlikely, although it is officially allowed to participate in tenders.","The government has also introduced net metering for plants below 40 kilowatts.","Hungary reached 12% renewable electricity consumption in 2020, slightly overshooting its 2020 target of 11% renewable electricity. Solar power generation increased fivefold over 2018 to 2021 and reached 9% of Hungarian power generation.

Residential tariffs in 2021 averaged €101/MWh, only half of the EU average of 228. Over 90% of households are on government-regulated tariffs.","Tariffs fell substantially in 2013 when the government imposed a 20% reduction in regulated residential electricity prices at the expense of power companies. Prices are still below cost, forcing utilities to cover the difference. The European Commission has repeatedly asked the government to enforce fully the energy directives and to adjust tariffs to reflect costs. For instance, in July 2018, the EC took Hungary to court over the exclusion of network costs in electricity tariffs. In July 2020, the court concluded that Hungary had not correctly implemented the EU “Third Energy Package” with regards to network tariffs.","Wholesale electricity prices in Hungary were slightly above the average EU level at around €50/MWh until 2020, but as prices rose in all EU countries in 2021 the Hungarian average price of around €90/MWh remained below the average. In 2020, as demand dropped during the Covid-19 pandemic, prices dropped to around €39/MWh. However, as global gas prices have spiked in 2021, Hungarian wholesale markets started rising."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Nuclear plants generate half of Hungary's electricity; gas and coal combine to provide one-third. Renewables, mainly biomass and wind, deliver the rest.","Hungary is a net importer of electricity, importing around 30% of annual power consumption over 2010-2020. Hungary is highly dependent on Russian energy imports – which the EU wants to limit. As a result, the European Commission gave approval for two new nuclear reactors at the Paks site, with a total capacity of 1.2 gigawatts, potentially limiting the opportunity for renewables.","Solar PV is expected to continue its recent growth supported by the METAR tenders, as Hungary aims to increase its share of renewable electricity from 12% in 2020 to 21% in 2030. An increasing amount of electricity is traded according to market principles, and the volume of electricity sold on the wholesale market grew sevenfold from 2019 to 2020.","Both generation and retail markets are highly concentrated. State-owned MVM’s market share in generation grew from about 40% in 2010 to around 60% in 2020.

Policy uncertainty under a historically interventionist government could resurface as a deterrent for investors.","The introduction of the METAR renewables program led to substantial growth in solar investment, with almost $1 billion invested between 2018 and July 2022.
