The government lowered import taxes for hybrids in 2010 and for EVs five years later.","The Clean Air 2025 Action Plan provides a roadmap for air-quality management. Among its measures, the plan called for the government to allocate 100 million rupees promoting solar-powered charging units for battery-electric vehicles, financing that would also help attract private investment. Besides, president Ranil Wickremesinghe said in August 2022 that newly purchased state vehicles would be exclusively battery powered.","There are over 100 EV charging stations in Sri Lanka, in line with the  government’s 2020 target and the country's plan to obtain a minimum 20% of its energy from renewable sources.","The government unified its import and excise taxes on cars and raised the levy in 2019.

The type of vehicle that they are able to import will depend on the amount transferred – $3,000 would allow the import of an electric motorcycle, while $20,000 would allow the import of an EV of a value up to $65,000.
