In 2008, under Decree No. 1002, the government established auctions to contract on-grid renewable capacity every two years. Since then, five auctions have been held, totaling 1.55 gigawatts of biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. Peru was among the first countries to hold off-grid energy auctions.","Although auctions remained on hold throughout 2021, Peru in December announced several new projects (with one already commissioned as of October 2022), with a solar photovoltaic capacity of 100 megawatts and more than 100 megawatt-hours of energy storage projects.","According to Supreme Decree No. 064-2010, the country intends for renewable energy to make up 15% of power generation by 2030. The importance of this decree is that it has influenced several policies that were defined afterwards.","The Ministry of Energy and Mines in 2015 published Decree 1221, aiming to improve the regulation of electricity distribution and promote access to electricity in Peru. However, it took until 2018 for the Supreme Decree for the regulation of distributed generation to be published for public comments. It proposes a net-billing scheme for installations with up to 200 kilowatts of power, but also a scheme for projects up to 10 megawatts. This decree also establishes that renewable energy generators that are connected to the grid have a feed into the grid, if this doesn’t affect the distribution system. This is intended to provide a significant boost to small-scale solar capacity.","Peru offers priority dispatch to clean energy plants and 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects.","According to Decree 1002, the generation of electricity from renewable energy resources is prioritized for daily dispatch carried out by the Committee of Economic Operation of the System (COES), which will be considered as having a zero variable production cost."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Power prices in Peru have risen considerably over the past few years.

In recent years, such investment has plummeted in the country, dropping to $300 million in 2017 and less than $2 million in 2018. The country has received capital from international and national commercial financial institutions, as well as development banks. The biggest lead arrangers are US Overseas Private Investment Corp.

The plan is to use a combination of off grid PV systems and net metering schemes. The project is under development but does not have a confirmed date of completion.","Peru’s energy consumption has been stable, averaging a 2% increase in demand over the past two years. The country also has fossil fuel subsidies, which it plans to eliminate by 2030. These have created market distortions by artificially lowering the price of gasoline and diesel.","With regard to green hydrogen, a program focused on the promotion and development of green hydrogen is among the long shot ideas that are being considered this year by the newly created domestic hydrogen association commission, H2 Peru.","In terms of corporate power purchase agreements (PPAs), Anglo American signed a 245-megawatt onshore wind deal with Engie in April 2021 in Peru.
