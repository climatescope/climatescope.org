However, its main tool to achieve that is through an 880MW extension of the Mochovce nuclear power plant. The extension was started in 1985 but has been subject to several delays. At the end of 2020, the project secured a promise of loans from Italy and Czech companies. The government has also sought to improve power market integration, with short-term trading with the Czech Republic and Hungary starting in 2012, and the day-ahead market coupled with the Czech Republic, Hungary and Romania, opening in late 2014.
