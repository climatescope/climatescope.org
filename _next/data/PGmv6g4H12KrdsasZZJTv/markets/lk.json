Total installed power capacity was around 4,265 megawatts in 2020, 50% of which came from non-fossil fuels, including hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Of total demand, 36% was met by non-fossil fuel generation.","Sri Lanka’s power market is still a long way from liberalization. Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the dominant utility, is yet to be unbundled. CEB controls a large chunk of the generation and distribution market. It is also the only transmission licensee, which makes proceeding with reform of the power market difficult.","Besides CEB, Lanka Electricity Company (LECO) – owned by CEB ? is the only other participant in the power distribution sector. CEB sells power to LECO, which then resells to end-use customers. Commercial and industry customers cannot sign bilateral contracts with generators directly.

Two types of tariff categories are provided – block tariffs and time of use (ToU) tariffs. The block tariff charges residences on an incremental basis based on monthly power consumption. Under the ToU tariff, electricity prices are charged at Rs.13(7 U.S. cents) per kWh during off peak hours (10:30pm – 5:30am), Rs.25 per kWh during day hours (5:30am – 6:30pm), and Rs.54 per kWh during peak hours (6:30pm – 10:30pm), all with a fixed charge of Rs. 540 per month.

Rooftop solar is a bright spark in the renewable energy sector. Rooftop solar connections rose 26% to 275 megawatts in 2020 from 217 megawatts a year earlier. The availability of a net metering scheme coupled with high tariffs have incentivized growth in solar installation capacity. Imports of equipment for renewable energy including solar panels and storage batteries, for example, are exempt from the national building tax (NBT), as well as the ports and airport levy (PAL).","The country hasn’t implemented any battery storage into the grid system but has an ambitious goal. Sri Lanka's grid is isolated – it has yet to establish connections with any of its neighbors – which also impacts future planning.","Off-grid generation is available in some locations, usually due to the unavailability of the national grid or as a matter of policy. Additionally, standby power supplies are also available in most industrial and commercial facilities.

A host of pilot projects described as \"exotic technologies\" are in the pipeline. They include large-scale battery storage, ocean energy, small wind power vertical-type systems and hybrid power systems combining solar, wind and batteries.","The Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB)’s short-term borrowings from state banks and total debt to the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) and independent power producers (IPPs) increased to Rs. 223 billion by the end of 2019, from Rs. 142 billion by end 2018.

This is due to the strict and aggressive vehicles taxation scheme that provides substantial tax reductions for hybrids imported into the country since 2010 and for electric vehicles since 2015.

An annual budget of Rs. 5 million will be used as financial assistance, support, and tax concessions for energy efficient technologies used in hybrids and EVs.","In 2017, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced plans to replace all state-owned vehicles with electric or hybrid models by 2025, a move that will be extended to private vehicles by 2040. The Sri Lankan government was also reported to have made a strategic decision to install more than 100 electric vehicle charging stations by 2020 to align with the country's plan to obtain a minimum 20% of its energy from renewable sources.","The government reduced the exercise duty on EVs from March 15, 2019.
