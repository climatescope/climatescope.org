In 2019, just under a third of the country’s power came from oil- and diesel-fired plants. Hydro accounted for 25% of generation, while renewables (biomass, solar and wind) were a combined 39.5%. Solar capacity has grown by 21% since 2015 to over 640MW in 2019. The Honduras wholesale market started operations in June 2019 and the country is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System (SIEPAC) meaning it is connected to El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua via transmission lines. Honduras is a net importer in the regional market.","From 2010-2019, Honduras attracted $2.7 billion in new clean energy investment, driven by $1.3 billion for solar from 2014-2019. These investments were boosted by a feed-in premium for renewables that came into force in August 2013. PV projects up to 300MW installed by July 31, 2015 were eligible to receive a base price for their energy equal to the short-term marginal cost plus $0.03/kWh plus 10%.

ENEE faces serious financial problems and has renegotiated earlier feed-in premiums with domestic and foreign companies owning clean energy projects in Honduras. In late 2018, the government announced an agreement to renegotiate the contracts. However, only domestic companies accepted the $0.03/kWh tariff cut. Meanwhile, ENEE continues to grapple with financial challenges.","In addition, the Honduras transmission network remains shaky.
