energy policy","value":"Kenya is in the process of transiting its renewable energy policy from a feed-in tariff scheme launched in 2012 to an auction-based one. Under the feed-in tariff, the fixed tariff of $0.12/kWh for solar projects of 10-40MW has led to an oversupply in proposed sites. This surplus reduced the incentive to rush large projects to commissioning, and as of August 2018, the rate is no longer available. A draft bill to introduce the auction scheme passed in parliament in August, but the government has not clarified further details yet. The government plans to price tariffs for below 10MW solar projects in local currency although it is uncertain when it will take effect or if it will affect operational power plants."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Geothermal accounts for 50% of Kenya’s clean energy investments, which overall amounted to $3.4 billion between 2010 and 2Q 2018. Wind is in second place with 39% of investments. The feed-in tariff and significant past experience in geothermal development means uncertainty about exploration and development of new projects or capacity additions is relatively low, and loans are available from development finance institutions. The majority of the investment in the wind sector was asset financing for the 310MW Lake Turkana wind project. In October 2017, Kenya recorded the largest financing deal for solar in Sub-Saharan Africa, with the $80 million debt financing for M-KOPA, a pay-as-you-go solar firm. It was led by Kenya-based Stanbic Bank’s $55 million debt denominated in local currency."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Kenya’s electricity tariffs are set by the Electricity Act of 2006. On August 1, 2018, the Electricity Regulation Commission scrapped the monthly fixed charge of 150 Kenyan shillings for all the consumer categories. This has led to the reduction in the overall unit power price from 23.49 Kenyan shillings/kWh to 20.18 Kenyan shillings/kWh, a 14% drop. The power prices in Kenya are higher compared to the neighboring large economies such as Ethiopia and Tanzania, where cheap large-hydro power is available and the government regulates the tariffs lower than the costs respectively. Power prices could decline in Kenya after new renewable energy capacity is added and cheaper hydro electricity is imported from Ethiopia."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The liberalization of the generation market has seen 13 IPPs cut into KenGen’s market share, and the government has mandated Ketraco to compete with Kenya Power on transmission. Kenya Power monopolizes distribution and retail today, but the monopoly will end if the proposed Energy Bill passes the parliament in its current form. Large hydro and geothermal are the two main sources of the Kenya’s generation mix. The share of renewables stayed at 33% in 2017, but this is expected to increase in coming years as wind and solar projects (including Lake Turkana) come online and geothermal capacity is added. Retail electricity prices are fully regulated for all customer segments."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Kenya’s power demand is the highest compared to East African Community (EAC) countries, and has seen moderate growth of 5.8% CAGR from 2012/13 to 2016/17, reaching 7,701GWh per year. It was partially driven by growing demand from residential customers that could benefit from a subsidized grid connection cost. Kenya Power introduced night-time discounted tariff for manufacturers in December 2017, which is likely increase the industrial power demand in 2017/18. Overall, Kenya has a relatively friendly environment for doing business compared to the other countries in Sub-Saharan Africa. Its robust value chain and international lending presence relative to its EAC neighbors makes it the least susceptible to currency risk for developers."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Land access has been a challenge for both site selection and transmission connection. The Lake Turkana wind farm is expected to come online in 2018 after facing severe delays in the construction and transmission phases. Generally, administrative processes take a long time and developers often face reluctance by Kenya Power and ERC for the development of a new project. For small-scale renewable energy projects, the regulatory framework only requires a mini-grid permit for those with a generation capacity of 1-3MW and requires no permit or licence for those below 1MW projects. Regulations for on-site generation are light-handed."}]}
