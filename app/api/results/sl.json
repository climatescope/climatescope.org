energy policy","value":"In 2017, the parliament of Sierra Leone ratified the country's renewable energy policy for 79.7% and 84% of final energy to come from renewables by 2020 and 2030, respectively, but there has been little progress since then to implement supportive policies to achieve these targets.\nThe government has not introduced any auctions or feed-in tariffs to encourage private power producers to build clean energy projects and there is a lack of progress as a result.\nSierra Leone's energy mix consists largely of biomass and hydropower generation, although a large amount is currently supplied by diesel ships moored off the capital, Freetown. The proportion of oil and diesel-powered generation could theoretically be replaced by solar power if more effective incentive mechanisms were introduced."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Sierra Leone's economic recovery has been volatile since the country was declared ebola-free in 2016 and investment in new power generation has yet to pick up following the crisis. \nConcessional finance is the predominant source of capital to the sector, with funding from the World Bank and African Development Bank going to rural electrification projects and little private sector involvement. \nThere is progress, however, in the pico-solar industry with the entrance of new companies. Some commercial lenders are now willing to finance larger projects that sell to the state-owned utility through a PPA."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs can be unstable in Sierra Leone, and stabilization clauses are often written into PPAs as a result. There has been considerable variation over the last few years, according to Climatescope data.\nPower prices for commercial, industrial and residential customers are becoming more harmonized after efforts by EDSA to adjust heavy subsidization that was previously distorting prices.\nFor bulk supply, most of the utility's procurement costs are unknown. A deal signed with the Turkish Karadeniz Powership in 2017 was negotiated at 16.4'/kWh for 30MW of baseload supply over five years."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Sierra Leone's National Electricity Act separated the Electricity Board into two state-owned entities: the Electricity Generation and Transmission Corp. (EGTC) and Electricity Distribution and Supply Authority (EDSA) in 2011. The country's power system is extremely dependent on seasonal hydro generation operated by EGTC and procured by EDSA through PPAs approved by regulators. EDSA can also procure power through PPAs with independent power producers, but the weak economic and political environment is not conducive to building new power projects. \nThe arrival of the Karpowership, a floating power plant, in Freetown Harbor in late 2017 has relieved some stress on system and power prices, but issues remain. There has been no progress on planned solar projects as yet."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Sierra Leone is becoming more attractive for renewables development, as the government cracks down on corruption and the state intends to push ahead with electricity sector reform.\nThe pico-solar industry is growing, with international companies BBOXX and Easy Solar offering PAYG models and mobile money payments becoming more common. Exemption from import and sales taxes for solar and energy efficiency products also benefits the industry, although red tape often makes it difficult to receive the exemptions.\nThe lack of domestic manufacturing and financial instability of offtaker EDSA makes project development more challenging, but energy development in other West African countries bodes well for Sierra Leone's future. \nThere is significant potential to expand both hydro and solar generation to broaden electricity access."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The lack of supportive policy and a uniform offtake arrangement are the most significant barriers to Sierra Leone's clean energy industry. Improving energy access remains an important social issue, but the government's immediate priorities lie in addressing corruption within its own ranks and improving health and wellbeing following the ebola crisis.\nExemption from VAT and import duties for solar and energy-efficiency products is a good first step, but the bureaucracy entailed in achieving these exemptions often makes them not worthwhile. Other barriers include the financial instability of offtaker EDSA and currency risk. \nThe nation's weak and limited grid also presents challenges for new capacity rollout, and the country's distinct wet and dry seasons pose challenges to plan and operate a system dependent on hydroelectric generation."}]}
