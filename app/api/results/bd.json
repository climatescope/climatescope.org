energy policy","value":"Bangladesh has an ambitious policy to consume 10% renewable energy by 2020 from 2% in 2018, including hydro. It will need 2GW of renewable projects to meet this target and is also preparing a net-metering policy to spur investments in the rooftop solar segment. The project developments on the ground, however, are very slow as IPPs struggle to secure land for projects and right-of-way to build transmission lines.  Some renewable projects have had quite generous feed-in tariffs set by regulators, but delays in getting project approvals mean most of these may be cancelled. Regulators want to conduct an auction to build projects in a solar park but these may not be awarded before 2019."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investments in grid connected projects are rare in Bangladesh – all new money is flowing into a few rooftop solar projects being developed by export companies. Apparel manufacturers are responding to pressure from purchasers in the U.S. and Europe that aim to decarbonize their supply chains. No wind projects have been installed in Bangladesh in many years. This might change as USAID is conducting a wind-resource assessment that could be the basis for wind power policy and investments. Almost all renewable financing is provided by domestic lenders that in turn have access to credit lines from multilateral and development banks. Infrastructure Development Company Limited is the biggest recipient and disburser of renewable financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average power prices in Bangladesh are lower than in neighboring India even though the smaller country generates most of its electricity from more expensive natural gas compared to cheap domestic coal in India. To keep the retail tariffs low, the government provides subsidies at two levels – by selling fuel to power generation companies below the market rate and providing subsidies to the power distribution companies. Electricity prices have been rising almost every year but they are still not high enough to meet all the operational and new investment expenses of the power distribution companies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Bangladesh produces 70% of its electricity from gas power plants. However, as the country’s gas supplies dwindle, it plans to meet its rising electricity demand through imports from India, Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh is also investing in new coal and nuclear power projects with technical help from India and Russia. Private participation is allowed only in the power generation sector while transmission and distribution are owned by the government. The Bangladesh Power Development Board acts as a single wholesale-buyer of all electricity and thus restricts the options for sale of power. Currently there are no incentives for off-site captive generation and the selling of electricity by third-parties is restricted. Renewables, including hydro, produce only 2% of electricity and this may hold steady as rooftop solar projects increase in the coming years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bangladesh is an electricity deficit country where several large customers experience regular load shedding. The country will consume more electricity as the population increases and GDP rises. Several industries that had been receiving subsidized gas to generate their own power may start buying electricity from the grid in future as domestic gas supplies decrease and the country relies on often expensive imported gas. Most of the rural population in Bangladesh has access to electricity through the use of solar home systems. Further increases in power requirements will be met through a combination of grid extensions and minigrid projects"},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The slow pace of land acquisitions and delays in getting the necessary approvals are major barriers to investment in renewables in the country. A 200MW PV project being developed by SunEdison is on the verge of being cancelled due to permitting delays. Another 60MW wind project being evaluated by U.S.-DK Green Energy is also running behind schedule. The country does not have a history of operating large renewable projects but if any curtailments do happen then private IPPs will be the first ones to face it. Bangladesh does not have a well-developed domestic supply chain for renewable energy projects. Most equipment and technical expertise is imported, which increases the project costs compared to neighboring India."}]}
