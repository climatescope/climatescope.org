energy policy","value":"Bangladesh has an ambitious policy to increase the renewable energy generation share to 10% by 2020, including large hydro, from less than 2% in 2018. It will need 2GW of renewable projects to meet this target, and is also promoting a net-metering policy to spur investments in the rooftop solar segment. The development of projects on the ground, however, is very slow as independent power producers struggle to secure land for setting up plants and right-of-way to build transmission lines. Some renewable projects have secured fairly generous feed-in tariffs set by regulators, but delays in getting project approvals means that most of these may be cancelled. Regulators want to conduct auctions to build projects in a solar park but, so far, little progress has been made."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in grid-connected projects is starting to pick up in Bangladesh ' money is also flowing into some rooftop solar projects being developed by garment export companies. Apparel manufacturers are responding to pressure from purchasers in the U.S. and Europe that aim to decarbonize their supply chains. No wind projects have been installed in Bangladesh in many years. This could change, but land constraints, high equipment costs and lack of domestic supply chain are deterrents. Almost all renewables financing is provided by domestic lenders that in turn have access to credit lines from multilateral institutions and development banks. Infrastructure Development Company Limited or Idcol is the biggest recipient and disburser of renewable financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Average power prices in Bangladesh are lower than in neighboring India, even though the smaller country generates most of its electricity from more expensive natural gas compared to cheap domestic coal in India. To keep the retail tariffs low, the government provides subsidies at two levels ' by selling fuel to power generation companies below the market rate and providing subsidies to the power distribution companies. Electricity prices have been rising at regular intervals over the past few years but they are still not high enough to meet all the operational and new investment expenses of the power distribution companies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Bangladesh produces 70% of its electricity from gas power plants. However, as the country's gas supplies dwindle, it plans to meet its rising electricity demand through imports from India, Nepal and Bhutan. Bangladesh is also investing in new coal and nuclear power projects with technical help from India and Russia. Private participation is allowed only in the power generation sector while transmission and distribution are owned by the government. Bangladesh Power Development Board acts as a single wholesale-buyer of all electricity. Currently, there are no incentives for off-site captive generation and third-party sale of electricity is restricted. Renewables, including large hydro, produce only 2% of electricity. This share may hold steady as rooftop solar projects increase in the coming years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Bangladesh is an electricity deficit country where several large customers experience regular load shedding. The country will consume more electricity as the population increases and GDP rises. Several industries that had been receiving subsidized gas to generate their own power may start buying electricity from the grid as domestic gas supplies decrease and the country's reliance on expensive imported gas increases. Most of the rural population in Bangladesh has access to electricity through the use of solar home systems. Further increases in the country's power requirements will be met through a combination of new power generation projects and electricity imports from India."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The slow pace of land acquisition and delays in getting the necessary approvals are major barriers to investment in renewables in the country. Bangladesh does not have a history of operating large renewable projects but if any curtailments do happen, then private independent power producers will be the first ones to face it. Bangladesh does not have a well-developed domestic supply chain for renewable energy projects. Most equipment and technical expertise is imported, which increases the project costs compared to neighboring India. Government subsidies for power generated from coal and gas power plants distorts the market pricing and increases the price competitiveness barrier for renewable energy projects."}]}
