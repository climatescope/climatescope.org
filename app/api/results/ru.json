energy policy","value":"Renewable energy (excluding large hydro) accounts for less than 1% of Russia’s power generation, but the country aims to bring this figure to 2.5% by 2024. The sole policy implemented to achieve this goal is an auction program that grants fixed 15-year capacity payments to government-approved renewable energy projects. Since 2013, the government has awarded over 5GW of wind, solar and small hydro capacity to developers across six annual auction rounds. As part of its nationally determined contribution, Russia intends to limit greenhouse-gas emissions to 70-75% of 1990 levels by 2030. Still, since its emissions have remained below 70% of 1990 levels since the collapse of the Soviet Union, the country is already on track to meet this target even if its greenhouse-gas output increases."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Russia has only built a handful of wind and solar projects, but about 5GW of wind, solar and small hydro capacity is in the pipeline. While many developers have missed commissioning targets for projects awarded in early renewables auctions, the arrival of foreign players such as Fortum, Enel, Lagerway and Vestas in the last two rounds suggests Russia may actually start to bring awarded clean energy capacity online. Regardless, the country will continue to produce a significant share of power from low-carbon sources. Nuclear and large hydro, for example, account for about 19% and 17% of Russia’s power generation mix, respectively."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Russia has low power prices relative to its European neighbors, due to an abundance of natural gas and government subsidies. Still, the Ministry of Energy reports that electricity rates have been inching up in recent years, and BNEF estimates that commercial and residential retail prices have risen to around $53-57/MWh as of 2017. Low electricity prices are a common feature of power markets throughout countries of the former Soviet Union, but rates are likely to continue increasing as Russia works to modernize its ageing power fleet."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Russia’s electricity market is broken into competitive 'price zones' where there are wholesale power markets (including: European Russia, the Urals and Siberia); non-competitive areas where there are regulated power rates (for example: the Far East); and isolated areas where there are no wholesale power markets (for example: Sakhalin). Power transmission is entirely state-run (by the Federal Grid Company) and both power generation and distribution are mostly state-controlled. At the end of 2017, Russia had an installed power capacity of 239GW."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Russia has long had a 100% electrification rate. Due to some improvements in energy efficiency and stagnant economic growth, the country’s peak power demand has remained relatively flat for the past seven years, fluctuating between 150GW and 155GW. State-controlled companies dominate most of the power sector. EU and U.S. sanctions have prevented most Western companies from operating in the country, though some have recently set up joint ventures with state-run players to enter Russia’s nascent renewables market. Issues such as currency volatility and government corruption remain serious barriers to doing business in Russia."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Climbing local content requirements, unpredictable currency fluctuations and forecasts for flat electricity demand remain significant barriers to organic renewable energy market growth in Russia. While about 5GW of renewables is already in the pipeline and domestic renewables manufacturing capacity is ramping up, large-scale deployment of renewables outside the auction program is unlikely. Fossil fuels dominate Russia's electricity sector, accounting for over 60% of the country’s power generation, and the government is in no hurry to displace its national energy giants or ratify the Paris Agreement."}]}
