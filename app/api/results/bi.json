energy policy","value":"Burundi's Electricity Law, last updated in 2015, establishes rules for the development of new generation sites, including the possibility of public-private partnerships, and specific regulation for hydro power plants. The country's rural electrification program is planned mainly around grid extensions and decentralized solutions. The country has a specialized Rural Electrification Agency, which aims to plan and develop projects to electrify isolated areas. The only effective support for renewables developers in Burundi is import-tariff exemptions for solar and wind equipment established by the East African Community, of which Burundi is a member. There are no fiscal incentives or other policy instruments such as feed-in tariffs. There are no specific legal tools to discourage fossil fuels. Burundi has committed unconditionally to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3% compared to a business-as-usual scenario for 2030, as part of its nationally determined contribution."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There has been significant under-investment in the energy sector. As a result, the country has an extremely low electrification rate of 10% nationally and less than 2% in rural areas by end-2018. The country has also opened its energy sector to privatization. Uptake of this opportunity has been limited, but one notable investment in 2017 included a 7.5MW solar plant, in which Gigawatt Global signed a 25-year PPA with the national utility, Regideso. Other foreign investment in the energy sector in Burundi has primarily been made by the development banks. In 2019, the World Bank, European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, European Union, African Development Bank, Burundi's government and national utility Regideso raised $270 million to start building the 50MW Jiji-Murembwe hydro power plant. Investment in rural electrification is being undertaken by the Burundian Agency for Rural Electrification. The objective of this entity is to develop and implement rural electrification projects, including small-scale hydropower, solar and wind energy."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs are set by the monopoly electricity supplier, Regideso. Power prices are extremely high, considering the high proportion of hydro, with average tariffs being among the world's most expensive. The increasing lack of power supply has been driving these high tariffs, along with grid inefficiencies and a lack of investment into new infrastructure. In 2017, amid the lack of power supply, Regideso leased a 30MW gas power plant to supply the capital Bujumbura. The dependence on the thermal power plant has made electricity tariffs increase more since then."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The renewable energy installed capacity is dominated by small hydro power plants (55%), followed by natural gas (34%) solar PV (6%) and biomass (5%). The capital Bujumbura accounts for 95% of electricity consumed. Besides its national generation, Burundi also imports electricity from neighboring countries, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and Rwanda, through a cross-border hydropower complex. The power sector continues to be dominated by Regideso, which has a monopoly for electricity transmission, distribution and supply. Transmission, distribution and generation infrastructure is old and needs further modernization and investment."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Burundi is one of the poorest countries in the world and relies on foreign aid. The country has been facing civil wars for decades and since 2015, it is facing severe political tensions. Burundi is ranked 168 among 190 countries in the World's Bank Doing Business index for 2019. Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure, trade challenges, high taxes and low access to credit are among the main challenges for businesses. On the positive side, Burundi joined the East African Community in 2007 and started the implementation of the common external tariff in 2009. Burundi also made major reforms to improve the procedure for creating a new business. The relationship with the East African Community could be a good opportunity for Burundi to proceed with the country's participation in regional infrastructure projects, such as interconnection and shared hydro power plants with neighboring countries."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The country has faced difficulties attracting investment for energy infrastructure due to political instability and conflicts. The legal framework requires updating to attract private sector participation. The economic and political instability of the country has also affected human capital and the development of a skilled workforce. Bureaucracy and the purchasing power of the population are also an important barrier for clean-energy developers, along with the capital high risk derived from political instability."}]}
