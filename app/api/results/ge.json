energy policy","value":"Renewable energy installations in Georgia are motivated by winter supply constraints and energy diversification concerns, rather than a need to significantly reduce the carbon emissions of their electricity supply, which is mostly hydro and natural gas. There are plans for 600MW of wind projects, but these are currently being held in the approval stages. The government introduced a residential net-metering program for small-scale solar, but uptake has been limited. It is planning to hold auctions, but has not yet released guidelines or a schedule. Most of the activity in the energy sector is focused on liberalization, to align with EU requirements. Regulations and frameworks for this are being set by GNERC, the independent energy regulator."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Financing is well established and widely available for hydro projects, where the country has domestic expertise. Wind and solar projects use both domestic and international concessional financing from the Georgian Energy Development Fund (GEDF) and USAID. Most of the foreign investment interest has come from the Czech Republic, Germany and Asia. The potential for new wind and solar development is bringing in European players. The government believes that local banks would finance projects commercially, if there was an economic case, but without a feed-in tariff, this looks unlikely in the near future. The single wind and solar plants operating today were majority financed by the GEDF as demonstration projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Georgia’s electricity prices are fairly low due to legacy hydro assets that can supply power as cheaply as $0.01/kWh. The average retail rate is just under $0.10/kWh, but this tariff is stepped according to consumption. Customers with very low demand are given a special rate, supposedly as a subsidy for vulnerable consumers, and although there is no means-testing associated with the rate, it is applied automatically. Electricity prices have been rising, as the winter supply constraints worsen. Commercial and industrial prices are being increased to allow residential retail rates to be reduced. Georgia’s northern disputed territory of Abkhazia contains the country’s largest and cheapest hydropower plant, Khudoni.  There have been difficulties with collecting payments in the region. While the cost of wind and solar is falling, it is currently not competitive with existing hydropower plants."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Most of Georgia’s power is supplied by a mix of small and large hydro plants. They are supplemented by gas, especially in the winter, when supply is low. The country has significant interconnection with Armenia, Turkey and Russia, which it uses to balance its supply. Still, the country has ambitions of becoming an energy exporter. Hydro capacity additions are slowing due to public opposition to new large-scale developments. Wind is popular, and could increase significantly if the government approves the project pipeline. The power market is being liberalized. The vast majority of power is currently bought through contracts, but a wholesale market has been growing slowly. The generation market is diverse, with Czech, U.S., and domestic players all owning capacity. There is little market for corporate PPAs, though rising commercial and industrial power prices could increase demand."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Georgia has been rising for the past eight years, but is now levelling out. The majority of the growth comes from the rural population in the disputed northern region. There are plans to upgrade the grid and add new high-voltage lines in order to accommodate new renewable energy. Ageing hydropower plants are being refurbished to extend their lifetimes. The country is completely electrified, with little interest in off-grid developments."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Georgia has few barriers to foreign investment and development. There is little domestic expertise in wind and solar, so most developers partner with a foreign business for equipment supply and construction. The political risk to new projects is low, as each one is considered individually as a proposal from the developer. New projects are virtually guaranteed a grid connection, though the operator can negotiate with developers on the location, to avoid grid constraints. Generators receive 10-year PPAs for all of their generation in the winter months. During the summer they can export their power to other countries through Georgia’s significant interconnection. The new wholesale market offers PPAs with a 15-year term."}]}
