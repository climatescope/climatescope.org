In contrast, wholesale prices jumped from $96/MWh in 2015 to $141/MWh in 2018, representing an increase of 46% over the period.

Although generation is open to private players, it remains dominated by state-owned entities. The distribution segment is divided into three public companies: Edeeste, Edenorte and Edesur.

According to this document, national and international companies are allowed to participate, but additional details are not available. On May 27, 2019, CNE authorized 12 provisional concessions for electricity generation, of which two are wind projects and eight are photovoltaic projects corresponding to 874MW in total.

Renewable energy generators have dispatch priority and open access to transmission and distribution.\nBeyond that, the financial instability of the Corporación Dominicana de Empresas Eléctricas Estatales (CDEEE) and the subsidization of retail electricity prices jeopardizes project developers seeking financing and the low rates for electricity prices difficult the entrance of new energy technologies."}]}
