energy policy","value":"Vietnam's revised Power Development Plan VII (PDP) targets 6.5% of electricity generation from renewables in 2020 from an earlier goal of 4.5%, and raised the 2030 target to 10.7% from 6%. In terms of capacity, the plan has a conservative target of 850MW of solar and 800MW of wind in 2020, but scales up to an ambitious 12GW solar and 6GW wind in 2030. \nTo spur development in wind and solar, feed-in tariff (FiT) schemes were introduced. A wind FiT was first introduced in 2011 at $78/MWh, which failed to incentivize development. It was revised in September 2018, increasing the onshore wind FiT to $85/MWh and introducing an offshore wind FiT of $98/MWh, with a commissioning deadline of November 1, 2019. The Ministry of Industry and Trade (MOIT) first introduced a solar FiT of $93.5/MWh in April 2017. The scheme expired on June 30, 2019 and the industry is awaiting the announcement of the FiT mechanism post June 2019."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Vietnam has emerged as the hotspot for clean energy investment within Southeast Asia, driven by solar developments. Between 2012 and 2017, wind attracted $1.5 billion in investments, but only 189MW of wind was installed at the end of 2017. The introduction of the solar FiT in 2017 led to a solar boom over the last two years. The state utility Vietnam Electricity (EVN) reported 82 projects with a combined capacity of 4.46GW connected to the grid by June 30, 2019, achieving more than five times the country's 2020 target. Activity in onshore and offshore wind development is picking up too after the upward revision of the FiT, with 7.8GW in the pipeline.\n\nIn the infancy of the wind industry, development banks such as KfW and Vietnam Development Bank provided financing. There has been an increase in financing of renewable projects from local banks such as Bank for Investment and Development of Vietnam, Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development and Vietcombank over the last two years. Despite concerns over certain clauses in the power purchase agreements, financing from regional and foreign banks for renewable energy projects in Vietnam are on the rise."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail tariffs in Vietnam are heavily regulated and subsidized, and considered to be among the lowest in the Southeast Asian region. Retail tariffs below cost recovery levels challenged EVN's financial position. The tariffs remained almost flat from 2005 to 2010 and then began increasing until 2015, when they reached about $0.07/kWh. They were again flat in 2016 and 2017. In March 2019, average electricity retail tariffs increased by 8.36%. \n\nCoal is currently the cheapest source of generation in Vietnam, at $56-105/MWh. Vietnam's wind and solar industries are still in the early stages of development, with a limited domestic supply chain. However, interest from local and international developers is strong and the levelized cost of electricity for both solar and wind is expected to decrease as equipment costs fall globally and the industry matures."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Vietnam's power system is predominantly fossil fuel based with coal, gas and oil supplying 60% of generated electricity in 2018. Hydro's potential has been largely harnessed in Vietnam and accounts for 38% of supply. Renewable energy (excluding hydro) has a limited role in the current generation mix, with less than 1% of total supply.\n\nVietnam's power market is partially liberalized, with the generation sector open for private participation. EVN and its subsidiaries monopolize transmission, distribution and retailing of power. Vietnam operates on a single buyer model with EVN as the sole off-taker of all generated electricity. A power sector reform roadmap is in place. In 2012, the competitive generation market was established and unbundled EVN's power generation function. In the second phase of liberalization, Vietnam introduced the competitive wholesale market in 2019. A competitive retail market is targeted after 2021. A mechanism for direct purchase of power by corporates is also under development."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand grew at an average rate of 11% annually between 2014 and 2018 on the back of a growing manufacturing industry. This rapid growth resulted in a tripling of electricity generation from coal in the same period. Vietnam plans to more than triple coal capacity again, from 17GW in 2017 to 55GW by 2030. The country has an electrification rate of 99.2% with the urban population fully electrified. Most of the solar and wind potential areas lie in the low power demand regions in the country."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Vietnam's power generation market is open to foreign investment with no foreign ownership cap. Equipment for renewable projects is exempt from import duties and there is a corporate tax exemption for project developers. The permitting process in Vietnam is lengthy with many different provincial and national ministries involved. Clauses in the power purchase agreement that deviate from international practices, such as the lack of international arbitration or take-or-pay arrangements, are a concern to international developers and financiers. The result of heavily subsidized retail tariffs can be seen in EVN's numbers. The absence of a government guarantee for EVN's payables presents a significant offtaker risk for some market players. Curtailment is, however, considered to be the highest risk at the moment. Solar and wind projects have congregated in the central and southern region where solar irradiance and wind resources are the best. More capacity than the grid has available has been connected in some provinces, leading to curtailment for some projects."}]}
