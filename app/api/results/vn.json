the 2030 target to 10.7% from 6%.  The 2020 target looks achievable as it only requires a cumulative capacity of 800MW of wind capacity, 850MW of solar and 750MW of biomass. The wind feed-in tariff has been revised for the first time since 2011, and has been raised to $0.085/kWh from $0.078 for onshore wind and to $0.098 for offshore wind. The solar feed-in tariff of $0.0935/kWh is one of the highest in the region. The interest from developers is reflected in the solar and wind projects approved by the Prime Minister and the Ministry of Industry and Trade."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment is expected to pick up as approved wind and solar projects obtain financing. The clean energy investments in the first half of 2018 is close $1 billion, which is higher than the past annual clean energy investments. Small hydro makes up the majority of current renewables investments in the country but solar and wind will dominate in new investments. The Vietnam Bank for Agriculture and Rural Development is one of the biggest investors in renewable energy. Some of the other major investors include Asian Development Bank, Sumitomo and local financiers like State Bank of Vietnam and Vietnam Development. There is limited participation from foreign banks and funds owing to concerns about the bankability of PPAs."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail tariffs in Vietnam are considered to be among the lowest in the region. The tariffs remained almost flat from 2005 to 2010 and then began increasing till 2015, when they reached about $0.07/kWh. They were again flat in 2016 and 2017. Electricity prices for industrial customers are regulated based on voltage level and time-of-day usage. The residential tariffs are heavily subsidized. Despite concerns over solar PPAs, there is strong interest from private developers due to the high solar feed-in tariff rate and recent increase for wind."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Large hydro and coal made up 75% of the installed capacity in 2017. Vietnam is one of the fastest growing electricity markets, with 11% CAGR of installed capacity in the past five years. Around two-thirds of the capacity installed in the last five years is coal-fired. Electricity imports from China and Laos were around 1.2% in 2017. Solar and wind are expected to play a major role to meet the renewables targets of 2020. The generation market is concentrated, with the government controlling about 60% of the installed capacity. No corporate PPAs were signed as of the end of 2017, but there is a lot of activity in the commercial and industrial rooftop PV sector."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak power demand has been growing at an average of 11% annually since the start of the decade. This rapid growth has resulted in a threefold increase in electricity generation from coal in the same period. Vietnam plans to increase coal capacity threefold again from 17GW in 2017 to 55GW by 2030. The country has an electrification rate of 99.2% with the urban population fully electrified.

Most of the manufacturers import solar PV cells and pay 0% import duties, assemble them in Vietnam and export them due to lack of domestic demand. There is high dispatch risk as EVN has no obligation to purchase electricity while there is grid availability. The result of heavily subsidized retail tariffs can be seen in EVN’s financials. The offtaker risk is high as there is no government guarantee against EVN."}]}
