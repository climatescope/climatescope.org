energy policy","value":"In April 2017, the Republic of North Macedonia amended its National Renewable Energy Action Plan, lowering its target to source 28% of generation from renewable sources by 2020 to an achievable 24%, due to a recalculation of historical biomass use in their baseline. It also pushed the original 2020 target to 2030. The country has moved to feed-in premiums for large solar projects, while wind and small hydro projects are eligible for feed-in tariffs. A government-supported feed-in-tariff is the price that is paid to a generator per MWh fed into the grid, a feed-in-premium is a much smaller amount paid per MWh fed into the grid. A feed-in-premium is meant to supplement other revenues that a generator is assumed to be receiving, such as a power price from the free market. Electricity offtakers are required to purchase the producers' generation for the agreement's duration. Small-scale solar projects await the publication of rules with details on how they will be compensated for supplying electricity to the grid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"With its lignite resource expected to dwindle substantially over the next decade, North Macedonia faces the option of either importing coal or diversifying into natural gas and renewables. Efforts to expand natural gas transmission lines are underway, and the government plans to incentivize demand for natural gas for power and heating; options include converting the mothballed heavy oil-fired TEC Negotino power plant to natural gas. North Macedonia was the first country in the Western Balkans to erect a sizable wind farm ' a 36.8MW project at Bogdanci owned by ELEM. There are plans to expand Bogdanci's capacity to 50MW. \nThe government is offering concessions for investors looking into funding small hydropower plants, however, strong local opposition from environmentalists has pushed back against projects that they believe are sited poorly and  would have negative downstream impacts. Finance for wind and small hydro projects has mainly come from such international concessional donors as the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with local developers or the state utility providing smaller equity stakes."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"North Macedonia has some of the lowest electricity prices in Europe, with residential bills amounting to less than half that of the European average. Tariffs are gradually increasing due to the progressing electrification of household heating. The country typically has been a net importer of electricity, relying on its neighbors for nearly a third of its electricity annually. A national power exchange and market coupling with Bulgaria are expected to bring more transparency to wholesale power prices."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The North Macedonian power sector has been unbundled and partially privatized. State-owned ELEM's monopoly on generation ended in 2008 for big industrial consumers. Since 2014, 230 companies with annual revenues of at least 10 million euros ($11.38 million) are allowed to choose their supplier. ELEM maintains control of the country's two major coal power stations, with a combined capacity of 800MW, as well as most smaller generation assets. \nIndependent power producers are active in small hydro projects. Distribution is fully unbundled, although EVN, an Austrian utility, is the largest player and has enjoyed a monopoly on electricity distribution for over a decade. State-owned Mepso operates the electricity transmission system and has yet to be fully unbundled. The country is looking to set up an independent power exchange by the end of 2019, as well as couple with the Bulgarian market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"North Macedonia aspires to join the European Union and is working to streamline all operations with EU standards. While there is no one-stop shop overseeing all aspects of project development, recent years have seen progress being made in streamlining application processes. Having been defined by legislation, the timetable for handling applications is clear ' the average time for getting decision on applications is between one and two months."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A key obstacle in North Macedonia, specifically for renewables, is the difficulty in obtaining land. This is exacerbated by the large number of local institutions involved in enforcing procedures and licensing, in addition to the lack of coordination among the bodies involved. The government plans to overcome this by offering land and grid interconnection permits to winners of auctions for solar.  Offtaker risk is minimal, and curtailment is a non-issue given the low levels of variable renewables capacity connected to the grid."}]}
