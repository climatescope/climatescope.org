one of the poorest countries in the world, there are multiple barriers to project development in Burkina Faso. The country is politically unstable, and a military coup caused national unrest in 2015. There are few incentives in place for development and the regulatory process can be vague. In addition, the lack of transparency, purchasing power and weak financial stability further thwart the country’s attractiveness to investors. The state utility is heavily indebted, and so there has been insufficient investment in grid maintenance and fleet modernization. The main grid is consequently unreliable and congested, leading blackouts to be a common and lengthy occurrence."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has rapidly picked up in Burkina Faso since 2017, with a record $166 million invested in 2019 alone. Prior to 2019, the largest clean energy investments to take place in Burkina Faso were the 33MW Zagtouli PV plant, commissioned in 2017, and the 15MW Essakane PV plant, which came online in 2018. Together, these deals totaled $115 million of investment. The Zagtouli project, which signed a PPA with Sonabel, Burkina Faso’s utility, was supported by the EU and the AFD. The Essakane plant has a PPA with gold miner Iamgold and is partly financed by Banque Internationale pour le Commerce, l’Industrie et l’Artisanat du Burkina (BICIAB), a BNP Paribas Group subsidiary. It is therefore evident that commercial actors are willing to invest in solar in the country. Additional actors are slowly entering the market in the context of the government’s 155MW solar programme, including French companies Quadran, GreenWish, GreenYellow and Urbasolar, and Belgian companies, Syscom, Naange and Soltech."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Burkina Faso has limited clean energy policy. A few tenders have been held for small-scale solar projects and the government announced 155MW of utility-scale solar capacity to be tendered in 2019, with several other small projects also in the pipeline. In addition, the country offers tax exemptions on solar panels, although the incentive is somewhat limited as it does not extend to complementary equipment. In 2019, the country revised upward its clean energy target to aim for 55% renewables capacity by 2022, up from 50% by 2025. The proportion was at 19.5% in 2019, so there needs to be faster clean energy capacity growth in order to hit this target."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has been rising rapidly in Burkina Faso, with peak demand increasing on average by 9% a year since 2015. Electrification has barely kept up with this growing demand. The national electrification rate is 21%, yet only 3% of the rural population has access to electricity. Burkina Faso has great solar and hydro resources, but limited wind potential. The low rural electrification rate and high solar resources offer a significant opportunity for off-grid project development. Mini-grids can be owned and operated by private actors, but require an authorization or license if exceeding 250kW or 1MW respectively."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Power generation in Burkina Faso is dominated by thermal plants that run on expensive imported fuel. Sonabel has tried to keep up with rising demand by ramping up generation and by importing electricity. The power sector is partially liberalized and divided into two segments, of which the first covers urban areas, where Sonabel has a de facto monopoly, despite generation and distribution being open to private investment. The second segment covers rural areas, where local cooperatives (COOPELs) are responsible and are overseen by the rural electrification agency ABER. In this segment, the private sector may operate generation and off-grid distribution projects. The offtaker can be commercial, as in the case of the Essakane PV plant."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity costs in landlocked Burkina Faso are at the higher end of tariffs in the region, because the country needs to import expensive diesel to run its thermal power plants. The regulator ARSE sets a national fixed electricity tariff of $190/MWh, with no distinction between prices for commercial, industrial and residential users. The tariff has been more or less stable over the last five years, but it is not cost reflective, meaning that the national utility Sonabel is reliant upon government subsidies."}]}
