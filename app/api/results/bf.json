energy policy","value":"Burkina Faso has very limited clean energy policy. A few tenders have been held for small-scale solar projects and the government recently announced 155MW of solar capacity to be tendered with several other small projects also in the pipeline. Otherwise speaking, there is no auction program, feed-in tariff or net metering scheme in place or planned for the near future. The country aims to have a share of 50% renewables in its energy mix by 2025, up from just under 19% in 2018, so the planned solar tenders will help to bring the country closer to its target. Burkina Faso offers tax exemptions on solar panels. However, the complementary equipment is not tax exempt, which somewhat limits the incentive."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The largest clean energy investments to take place in Burkina Faso in recent years were the 33MW Zagtouli PV plant, commissioned in 2017, and the 15MW Essakane PV plant, which came online in 2018. Together, these deals totalled $115 million of investment. The Zagtouli project, which signed a PPA with Sonabel, Burkina Faso's utility, was supported by the EU and the AFD. The Essakane plant has a PPA with gold miner Iamgold and is partly financed by Banque Internationale pour le Commerce, l'Industrie et l'Artisanat du Burkina (BICIAB), a BNP Paribas Group subsidiary, suggesting that commercial actors are also willing to invest in solar in Burkina Faso. Additional actors are slowly entering the market in the context of the government's 155 MW solar programme, including French companies Quadran, GreenWish, GreenYellow and Urbasolar and Belgian companies, Syscom, Naange and Soltech."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity costs in landlocked Burkina Faso are on the higher end of tariffs in the region, as the country needs to import expensive diesel to run its thermal power plants. This situation was exacerbated in 2018, with diesel prices nearly doubling. The regulator ARSE sets a national fixed electricity tariff, with no distinction between prices for commercial, industrial and residential users. While the tariff has been stable over the last five years, it is not cost reflective, meaning that the national utility Sonabel is reliant upon government subsidies."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Power generation in Burkina Faso is dominated by thermal plants that run on expensive imported fuel. Sonabel has tried to keep up with rising demand by ramping up generation and by importing electricity, with imports rising from 145GWh in 2009 to 837GWh in 2018. The power sector is partly liberalized and divided in two segments, of which the first covers urban areas where Sonabel has a monopoly over all power market segments. Although generation is open to private actors, no IPPs are active. The second segment covers rural areas, where local cooperatives (COOPELs) are responsible, overseen by the rural electrification agency ABER. In this segment, the private sector may operate generation and off-grid distribution projects. The offtaker can be commercial, as in the case of the Essakane PV plant."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has been rising rapidly in Burkina Faso, with peak demand increasing on average by 9% a year since 2015. Electrification has barely kept up with this growing demand. The national electrification rate is 21%, yet only 3% of the rural population has access to electricity. Burkina Faso has great solar and hydro resources, but limited wind potential. The low rural electrification rate and high solar resources offer a large opportunity for off-grid project development. Mini-grids can be owned and operated by private actors, but require an authorization or license if exceeding 250kW or 1MW respectively."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"As one of the poorest countries in the world, there are multiple barriers to project development in Burkina Faso. The country is politically unstable, with a military coup causing unrest across the country in 2015. There are few incentives in place for development and a complex regulatory framework that impedes progress. In addition, the lack of transparency, purchasing power and financial stability further thwart the country's attractiveness to investors. As the state utility is heavily indebted, there has been insufficient investment in grid maintenance and fleet modernization. The main grid is consequently unreliable and congested and blackouts are a common and lengthy occurrence."}]}
