energy policy","value":"The Singapore government has set goals to reduce emissions intensity, improve energy efficiency and expand solar PV installations. It is targeting up to 2GWp of installed solar capacity by 2030, of which around 200MW had been set up by the end of 2018. Much of the development is constrained to rooftop and floating solar as the city-state's lack of land resources (indicated by the high population density) has proved an obstacle for ground-mounted grid-scale development. Solar rooftop tenders have delivered over 116MW installed capacity across nearly 1,500 public housing blocks."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The SolarNova program has been the driving force in solar PV adoption. The first two tenders under the program, awarded in 2015 and 2017, yielded 116MW of capacity. The third tender, awarded to Sembcorp and Kurihara Kogyo in June 2018, will add another 50MW. While not officially disclosed, it has been reported that the winning bid for the third tender was close to zero. This underlines the confidence that developers and investors have of recovering costs through the sale of excess generation. This excess can be sold into the wholesale market or to other commercial and industrial customers. Apple's agreement with Sunseap to power 100% of its Singapore operations with renewable-sourced electricity from the latter is an example of the direct sale model."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Singapore's power prices are linked to the price of oil; the city-state is 95% dependent on imported natural gas for generation, most of which is purchased at oil-linked prices. The average wholesale electricity price (Uniform Singapore Electricity Price or USEP) for 2018 was S$110/MWh ' a slight increase after years of price-depression caused by a large system reserve margin. The reserve margin stood at 80% in 2018 but is expected to fall to 58% in 2019, and go further down to 40% by 2022 following the retirement of 2,600MW of generation capacity. The liberalization of electricity retail in Singapore under the Open Electricity Market (OEM) regime in 2019 may mitigate somewhat the upward pressure on electricity bills from potentially higher wholesale prices emanating from declining reserve margins."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Tuas Power, Senoko, YTL, Keppel Merlimau, Sembcorp, PacificLight and Tuaspring account for 90% of the generation capacity in Singapore. Bids are submitted to the wholesale market operated by the Energy Market Company ' a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange. Prior to the inception of the OEM, only consumers whose monthly consumption exceeded 2MWh ('contestable' consumers) were allowed to purchase electricity from licensed private retailers. Those who didn't meet this consumption threshold ('non-contestable' consumers) had to purchase electricity at the regulated tariff from state-owned SP Group. Under the OEM regime, which rolled-out island wide in May 2019, all consumers, regardless of their monthly consumption, are allowed to purchase electricity from a licensed retailer. The retail market is highly competitive, with 28 licensed firms."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Singapore is a developed economy with strong legal and institutional frameworks in place to support business transactions and financing arrangements. The country has world-class infrastructure and office space, and a highly educated English speaking workforce. The government is also keen to attract foreign investment and developers into the market and is likely to attract more foreign players for subsequent tender rounds for SolarNova and floating PV projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The market is limited in terms of scale and the slow pace of market liberalization. Development, led by the government and public bodies, presents challenges in terms of timing and requires patience for investors looking to deploy capital in the country. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around the PV tenders ' and the reasons for success of some bidders ' is a barrier to new entrants hoping to understand the market."}]}
