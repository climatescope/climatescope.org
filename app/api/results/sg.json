energy policy","value":"The Singaporean government has set goals to reduce emissions intensity, improve energy efficiency and expand PV capacity within the city-state. A corner stone of its clean energy plans is the target for 350MW of installed PV capacity by 2020, of which around 150MW had been installed by end-2017. The government has announced its intention to increase the PV target to 1GW by an unspecified time after 2020. PV is the main focus for clean energy in Singapore as there is limited potential for other renewables technologies. Due to land constraints, rooftops and floating PV (on reservoirs and coastal waters) are key components of the government’s plans, and several pilots have been launched to test solar technologies and financial support frameworks. Solar rooftop tenders have delivered over 166MW across 2,300 buildings. The government aims to install PV systems on 5,500 public housing blocks by 2020."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in the country to date has been driven by the government-backed pilot schemes for floating and rooftop PV. The first SolarNova tender for 76MW was awarded in 2015 to Sunseap, with the second smaller tender for 40MW awarded to Million Lighting Co. in 2017. The most recent tender for 50MW was awarded in June 2018 to Sembcorp and Kurihara Kogyo. The terms of the SolarNova development contracts have not been disclosed but it has been reported that the winning bid for phase three was close to zero. Under the SolarNova Programme, developers must sign a service agreement to provide power to the HDB residences, but generation in excess of the terms of the service agreement can be sold into the wholesale market or contracted to other commercial and industrial customers. The zero bid reflects the expectation that costs can be recovered through the sale of excess generation. An example of this model is the recent announcement by Sembcorp that it has signed a 20-year agreement with Facebook to provide the company with renewable energy to power its offices and a new data center in the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Singapore power prices are heavily linked to the price of oil. The country is 95% dependent on imported natural gas for power generation, the majority of which is purchased at oil-linked prices. Wholesale prices, known as the Uniform Singapore Electricity Price (UESP), are around S$100/MWh (US$70/MWh) and reflect the short-run marginal cost of generation in the ‘contestable’ market (see below). It should be noted that the wholesale power price in Singapore is depressed by the significant level of generation overcapacity. The system reserve margin, a measure of operational capacity compared with peak demand, currently stands at 80%, meaning that almost half of the country’s power plants lie outside of the money. Non-contestable tariffs paid by small businesses and residential consumers (that make up around a quarter of total consumption) are high compared with international peers. The regulated tariff is currently around S$200/MWh (US$140/MWh) and is made up of energy costs (~70%), grid charges (~28%) and service and administration fees (~2%). The energy cost component of the regulated tariff is revised every quarter, whilst the grid charges and services fees are revised annually."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Six companies account for around 90% of power generation capacity in Singapore – Tuas Power, Senoko, YTL, Keppel Merlimau, Sembcorp, PacificLight and Tuaspring. Generators bid into the wholesale electricity market operated by the Energy Market Co., a subsidiary of Singapore Exchange. The retail power market is divided into ‘contestable’ and ‘non-contestable’ consumers. The contestable market serves industrial and commercial consumers that use over 2MWh of electricity per month. Licensed retailers, many of which are linked to generation companies, are permitted to sell power to contestable consumers at bespoke tariffs to meet the needs of customers. The contestable retail market is highly competitive, with around 30 licensed firms. Non-contestable consumers – small businesses and residences – must purchase their electricity from state-owned SP Group at a regulated tariff. The government launched a pilot program in April 2018 to liberalize the non-contested market in the district of Jurong, and plans to expand retail competition to the rest of the island. A market also exists for demand response where contestable consumers can bid to be paid to reduce their consumption during peak times."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Singapore is a developed economy with strong legal and institutional frameworks in place to support business transactions and financing arrangements. The country has world class infrastructure and office space, and a highly educated English speaking workforce. The government is also keen to attract foreign investment and developers into the market and is likely to attract more foreign players for subsequent tender rounds for SolarNova and floating PV projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The market is limited in terms of scale and the slow pace of market liberalization. Development led by the government and public bodies present challenges in terms of timing and requires patience for investor looking to deploy capital to opportunities in the country. Furthermore, the lack of transparency around the PV tenders and the reasons for successful bidders being awarded contracts is a barrier to new entrants hoping to understand the market."}]}
