energy policy","value":"Angola's electricity demand is predominantly met by large hydro. In 2018, the technology accounted for 60% of Angola's 5.3GW of installed capacity. The country aims to add 800MW of renewable energy capacity (500MW of biomass, 100MW of solar, 100MW of wind and 100MW of mini-hydro) by 2025, under the government's energy strategy \"Visao Angola Energia.' The $23-billion energy strategy for 2018-25 aims to reach 9.9GW of total capacity, and boost electricity-access rates from around 34% in 2018 to 60%. By this time, natural gas is to meet 20% of generation, hydro will account for 64%, while 8% will come from other renewables. Of the 9.9GW of new build, just under a third will be developed through public-private partnerships. Angola has no substantial incentives such as feed-in tariffs or auctions to promote renewable energy deployment, though it has signaled its intention to eventually do so via its \"Bet on Solar Energy Program\", which aims to tender a total of 200MW of solar, divided into five 40MW lots, by 2022."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"With an energy sector dominated by large hydro plants, Angola has not received significant investment in utility-scale clean energy plants in recent years. However, its 2025 energy strategy will require substantial investment in renewables, much of which is likely to come in the form of concessional financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Angola's residential and commercial electricity prices have not changed since 2013. At $27/MWh in 2018, they are among the lowest across emerging markets. Extensive fossil-fuel subsidies significantly affect the price at which electricity is offered by the state generation company, reducing the potential incentive for consumers to install small-scale PV. Angola does not have an industrial tariff or a wholesale power market. Electricity sector reform, which began in 2014, has sought to increase retail tariffs for electricity. These are now expected to be implemented in 2019. Currently, ENDE cannot charge cost-reflective tariffs and is dependent on government subsidy. Higher rates are expected to increase the financial viability of the utility and reduce subsidies to the sector, potentially attracting independent producers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Much of Angola's infrastructure was destroyed during its 27-year civil war, which ended in 2002, and had to be rebuilt and refurbished. A significant investment program has increased generation capacity from 700MW in 2002 to around 5.3GW in 2018. The country saw capacity grow 22% in 2018 as a result of the commissioning of the 750MW Soyo gas plant and additional phases of the Lauca hydroelectric dam. When fully commissioned, the flagship $4.3 billion Lauca will become the largest hydropower plant in Southern Africa, alongside Mozambique's CahoraBassa. Restructuring of the sector began in 2014 and has sought to strengthen the role of an independent regulator, IRSEA (Instituto Regulador do Sector Electrico). It has also sought to unbundle the power market, creating PRODEL-EP on the generation side, together with RNT and ENDE as the transmission- and distribution-system operators. Generation and distribution/retail are technically open to private participation, but private players have not entered either market yet. The power network is still fragmented across three regional grids (North, Central, and South) and some isolated systems, though the primary North-Central-South backbone connection is under way as of mid-2019."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Angola's economy contracted in 2018 for the third straight year, as a slower-than-expected economic recovery unfolds for the major oil producer. Declining crude production, falling oil exports and high inflation create a challenging outlook for a return to economic growth. Investments in generating capacity in the form of new large hydro facilities have improved reliability of power supply in the capital region in recent years, though soaring demand and population growth means progress on electrification will be challenging. Angola's electrification rate was just 34% in 2018, with much lower rates of access in rural areas. In spite of the country's explicit focus on development of abundant hydro resources, Angola has ambitious, if unsupported, near-term plans to develop renewable energy. It plans to connect over 500MW to the grid by 2022, and 800MW by 2025. The mapping of resources has been carried out to some extent across all technologies and several solar hybridization projects are under way, but no concrete steps have yet been taken to advance a planned solar auction program or to develop the country's first wind projects."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The 2015 Electricity Law established the legal framework for independent power producers (IPPs), and the government is working with the African Development Bank to implement a variety of measures necessary to modernize the sector and attract investment, including PPAs and feed-in tariffs. In the meantime, IPPs are still rare in Angola, and PPAs are negotiated on a case-by-case basis. The sector suffers from a number of inefficiencies: non-payment from customers is a challenge, with over 80% not metered. In addition, the cost of electricity production and distribution is high, the average consumer tariff is low, and official estimates of total sector losses are over 50%, of which 6% is tied to technical losses in transmission, 22% to technical and commercial issues in distribution, and 36% to (non) collection. While Angola does not have official barriers that would hinder import of renewables equipment, the average cost of importing in terms of border and documentary compliance far exceed Sub-Saharan Africa averages, according to recent surveys. Angola will introduce a VAT regime in 2019 at a standard rate of 14%."}]}
