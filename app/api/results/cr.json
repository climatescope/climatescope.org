The country's size, plentiful resources and conducive policies have made Brazil the region's main renewable energy market and one of the top 10 in the world. Its matrix remains highly reliant on hydropower, which accounted for roughly 65% of the country's generation in 2018. The heavy reliance on one source came at a high cost in 2014: a prolonged drought put Brazil's water supply and energy matrix into stress, exposing the market to costly generation from fossil-fueled plants. The hydro crisis emphasized the country's need for generation diversification. Auctions and net metering will continue to be crucial policies to develop Brazil's power sector. In terms of structure, the power market is fully unbundled and fairly evenly split between state-owned and private-sector players."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Costa Rica attracted $2.1 billion in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-2018. Over a third of that capital was directed to small hydro plants ($0.8 billion), followed by geothermal with $0.6 billion and wind with $0.6 billion. Investment peaked in 2014 with almost $0.6 billion provided to the three technologies, but it dropped by half in 2017. In 2018 Costa Rica attracted only $13.5 million to its clean power sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Costa Rican electricity prices rose in 2016 due to heavy use of diesel-fired generation to satisfy a 6.6% increase in electricity demand.

Residential and industrial prices increased about 3% from 2017 to 2018."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in Costa Rica is regulated and dominated by the vertically integrated Instituto Costarricense de Electricidad (ICE), which is the major generator in Costa Rica and the sole power purchaser in the country. However, the Costa Rican market allows private participation in the form of cooperatives and independent power producers. These entities can be involved with generation and distribution in some parts of the country.\nIn 2018, the country had an installed capacity of 3,601MW, with hydropower representing 66% (2,387MW) of the total. Oil and wind, respectively had 16% (572MW) and 10% (378MW) of the capacity.\nTotal generation in 2018 was 11,356GWh, mainly from hydropower with 73% (8,343GWh), followed by wind with 16% (1,799GWh)."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Costa Rica's government shows strong commitment to energy and climate-related incentives. However, high hydro penetration and slow demand growth limits new entrants in the market. Around 73% of the country's power generation is supplied by hydro, reducing the need for other clean energy sources for the country to meet its goals. Generation grew 20% between 2010 and 2018, while peak demand rose by 6% from 2015 to 2018."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to development of renewables in Costa Rica are low.
