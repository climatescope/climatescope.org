energy policy","value":"Historically, Botswana has lacked the legal framework and incentives to develop its renewable energy industry, with the National Energy Policy remaining in draft form since October 2009. An ambitious tender for 100MW of solar PV capacity announced in 2017 was cancelled in May 2019. The tender is expected to be re-issued and re-defined as an IPP project, with investors to become 100% owners of the plants. The stability of these tenders is questionable as a previous tender in 2015 also failed to move forward even after attracting more than 118 bids. Import and tax incentives apply to a wide range of manufacturing goods and there are no specific provisions for the renewables industry. The awareness of these incentives also remains low."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Only one grid-scale renewable energy project has been commissioned in Botswana to date ' the 1.3MW solar PV project located close to Phakalane. It was financed through a $12.5 million grant from the Japanese government. This is the only utility-scale renewable project to be financed in the last five years, making the current share of foreign investment stand at 100%. Botswana is open to foreign investment, but many project developers are unable to prepare the project proposals that meet the criteria necessary to attract international finance, according to the World Bank."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"For decades, electricity in Botswana has been heavily subsidized, but this is slowly changing with tariffs having increased in recent years. Private consumers have paid low power prices, which has led to the Botswana Power Corporation dispatching power at a loss. In an effort to create more cost-reflective tariffs, BPC has therefore gradually increased the tariffs and steadily reduced the subsidy from 2.4 billion Botswana pula ($220 million) to 1.4 billion Botswana pula with the intention to reduce it further to 800 million Botswana pula in 2018. Electricity tariffs have risen consistently over the last decade at an average of 10% annually. \n\nUp until three years ago, residential consumers were paying the highest electricity tariffs. This has now changed, with BPC now charging industrial customers the highest tariffs as the largest consumers of electricity. However, this change may need to be reviewed as the largest state mine in the country, BCL Mine Limited, was forced into liquidation and closed in 2016.\n\n\nUp until the 3 years residential consumers have paid the highest electricity tariffs. BPC now charges their biggest users, Industrial customers, the highest tariffs which may need to be reviewed seeing as the largest state mine in the country, BCL Mine Limited, was forced into liquidation and closed in 2016."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Botswana's power sector is dominated by coal, accounting for 79% of the current installed capacity. By contrast, solar PV accounts for just 0.1%, although this is expected to change with the development of a 100MW solar project that was re-issued in May 2019. Botswana has gradually weaned itself off dependency on imports from the SAAP, and it now imports only 23% of the distributed power nationally. There is only one operational 1.3MW solar plant in the country and renewables do not benefit from purchase obligation as BPC buys all the power available regardless of sector.\n\nCurrently, the Botswana Power Corporation is the sole provider of generation, transmission, distribution and retail services. However BPC is looking to transform itself into a transmission and distribution utility, and move away from being a fully-integrated utility. Independent power producers (IPP) have been allowed to enter the market since 2007 but have only began to expand into the generation market in the last two year with the signing of two PPAs' for the Morupule B Coal plant and a 1MW solar plant in 2017."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Botswana boasts an impressive electrification rate of 61%. Botswana's power demand has plateaued in recently years, sitting at 610MW for the last three years. Demand has peaked due to a slowdown in mining as a result of the commodities' price slump, whereby the largest state mine in the country filed for liquidation in 2016 and halted all operations. BPC has an aging power plant fleet with the oldest plant commissioned in the late 1980's. The plant is currently being refurbished and is expected to be operational in 2018."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Botswana, much like other Sub-Saharan countries, has introduced import duty exemptions for equipment and machinery including solar panels and inverters. The Manufacturing Investment Incentive is a broad policy to bolster the manufacturing sector. The incentives makes no special provision for the renewables industry, but do still present an opportunity to develop a manufacturing industry, provided that the local market becomes more stable. Offtaker risk poses a potential hurdle to this market, as the BPC has historically run at a loss. However, more recently the BPC has managed to reduce its losses to a minimum under the guidance of the newly-appointed CEO, Stefan Schwarzfischer. Unlike its neighbors, Botswana has little currency risk with the Pula strengthening against the dollar."}]}
