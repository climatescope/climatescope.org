target (including large hydro) by 2030. The plan also establishes interim renewables goals of 55% by 2018 and 64% by 2023. In 2018, the country reached a 58% share, with wind and geothermal the most representative renewable sources with 17% each. Renewable energy developers enjoy a full range of tax breaks, including import duty, VAT and income tax exemptions. Furthermore, on January 2018, the government of Nicaragua approved rules for net metering. It allows self-generators of up to 5MW of installed capacity to sell surplus electricity to Nicaragua's distribution companies."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Nicaragua attracted $942 million in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-16, but none has been disbursed since 2017. Wind has accounted for the highest share, a third of the total, followed by small hydro with $218 million and geothermal with $215 million."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Nicaragua rose slightly from 2016 to 2018, when industrial tariffs rose from $192 to $194/MWh. Commercial electricity prices are the second highest in Latin America and the Caribbean at $253/MWh, only after Jamaica's. Residential tariffs are significantly lower at $194/MWh, but still appear among the top seven most expensive tariffs in the region. Nicaragua's high retail prices are largely due to its dependence on imported fossil fuels for generation. Renewables development represents a path to greater energy independence for the country."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Renewables account for the biggest share of power generation, reaching 58% of the 4.6TWh produced in 2018 ' up from 47% in 2016. Fossil fuel plants are still responsible for a substantial share, but decreased from 52% in 2016 to 41% in 2018. Nicaragua's power sector is unbundled and distinct actors (both state- and privately owned) participate in the generation and distribution sectors. At least 18 companies with active generation contracts hold a large share of installed capacity. Nicaragua is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System (SIEPAC) and is connected to El Salvador, Guatemala, Panama, Costa Rica and Honduras by transmission lines."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Nicaragua's peak power demand jumped 28% over 2010-18, rising 6% on average over the first two years of the period. Growth then decelerated mainly due to an economy slowdown, reaching just 1% per year in 2015-18. Still, the government's National Expansion Plan 2017-2030 expects demand to grow 4.5% per year in that period."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A lack of active policy support programs is likely to stymie renewables deployment in Nicaragua. An exception is tax incentives to ease the clean energy project development process, which have been extended until 2023. High Electricity tariffs make it difficult to attract new business to the country. Moreover, the fragile condition of Nicaragua's transmission system jeopardizes service reliability."}]}
