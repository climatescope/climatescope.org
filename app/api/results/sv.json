energy policy","value":"El Salvador's government is focused on diversifying its power matrix and reducing its oil dependency by adding renewable energy capacity. Since 2013 the country has held three auctions, contracting 285MW of renewable capacity. It offers income and import tax exemptions to clean energy projects and guarantees priority dispatch to electricity generated from renewable sources."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"El Salvador's clean energy sector attracted $1 billion of investment over 2010-2018. Over half of the investment was directed to PV plants, which received $624 million, followed by $261 million for biomass and waste. Largely due to its successful clean energy auctions, over 65% of the total was recorded in 2016-2018."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"From 2015 to 2016, commercial, residential, industrial and wholesale electricity prices in El Salvador decreased on average by 20%. However, dry conditions in 2016 that reduced hydroelectric reservoir levels led to increased generation from fossil fuels, causing electricity prices to rise in 2017 and 2018. Commercial prices increased 8% from $199/MWh in 2016 to $215/MWh in 2018. Residential and wholesale prices increased by 20% and 23%, respectively, over the same period, while industrial prices rose by 17%."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"El Salvador had 1.9GW of installed capacity in 2018. Oil and diesel constitute the single largest source, with 38% of the total, followed by large hydro with 28%. Among renewables, biomass and geothermal dominate, with 15% (294MW) and 11% (204MW), respectively. PV capacity has increased four-fold since 2015, reaching 60MW in 2018. \nEl Salvador's power market has been unbundled, and generation is open to private operators. The country is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System and is connected to Guatemala and Honduras by 286km of transmission lines.\nBetween January and September 2019, El Salvador added 84MW more PV capacity to its grid. This increment is due to the commissioning of two PV projects. In March 2019, Real Infrastructure Capital Partners concluded a portfolio of three PV plants with a combined capacity of 44MW in the city of Acajutla: Los Remedios, La Trinidad and M'rquez. \nIn July 2019, AES El Salvador and the Guatemalan Corporación Multi Inversiones (CMI) installed 40MW of the 100MW Bosforo PV portfolio. Those plants are located in the cities of Santa Ana, San Sebastión Salitrillo, Sonsonate and Jiquilisco. With these new additions, El Salvador's solar capacity jumped 58% in less than one year."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"El Salvador's renewables boom is set to continue with more project completions in the next two years. Still, the country remains highly dependent on fossil fuels and hydro, exposing its market to price spikes during droughts and periods of high oil prices. Investment in renewables projects is seen as a path to minimize these impacts."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"El Salvador has seen low economic growth since 2000, and it has high levels of public debt. High crime levels add to the cost of doing business. Moreover, El Salvador has high exposure to natural disasters, which increases operating risk."}]}
