energy policy","value":"The Sultanate has ambitious plans to transition to a cleaner and more sustainable energy policy, with a target of 16% of electricity generation derived from renewable sources by 2025 and 30% by 2030 (starting from close to zero in 2018). Several renewable energy projects have been announced, tendered or are under construction, including utility-scale solar and wind plus a smaller waste-to-energy plant. In addition, incentives and an implementation plan are in place for a rooftop solar PV rollout among residential customers. Relative to other countries in the region, Oman has lagged behind in its implementation of diversification policies. The move to renewables is motivated by financial opportunity around selling its fossil fuels in the market rather than a climate-conscious focus."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The country's plans to implement clean-energy investment is very real, and Oman lags slightly behind other countries in the region so is motivated to progress quickly. The government has recently become very strategic about diversifying its energy and economic strategy. Not only will the fossil-fuel resource eventually run out, they are also paying an opportunity cost to use these resources, which could be managed more optimally. Specifically, combined power and water-desalination plants that were put in place 15-20 years ago are now a disaster in terms of efficiency. Across the region, massive investments are under way to replace these with efficient gas plants, reverse osmosis water plants and solar power. Oman is very well situated as the country enjoys some of the greatest resource potentials in the world for solar and wind."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Similar to other countries in the region, Oman's electricity prices are highly subsidized for residents. Prices paid by consumers were static from the early 1990s until 2017 and only covered about 54% of production costs. In 2017, the country introduced a cost-reflective tariff that removed subsidies for customers whose yearly use exceeds 150MWh (effectively commercial customers), charging them set prices based on typical demand profiles for the season and time of day. The intent was to incentivize conservation efforts by customers and had the effect of raising prices paid in total. In order to increase cash flow, the government decided to incentivize residential customers to install rooftop solar PV panels rather than decreasing subsidies. This will effectively cut their usage costs by around 40% while also decreasing the amount of subsidy paid. The power market is not competitive and prices paid for fuel and generated electricity are all set by various government agencies, acting in an orchestrated manner. Comparison of levelized costs of energy is therefore somewhat irrelevant."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"While Oman produces significantly more crude oil than natural gas, the Sultanate exports crude to the global market and uses gas to generate electricity for its own needs. A new strategic plan for energy and economics in the country will change the mix rapidly over the next 10 years. With 30% of generation slated to come from renewables, the country plans to increase its gas exports and generate additional revenue. Only 0.3% of Oman's renewable energy plan has been implemented so far at a planned slow pace. Oman is being very thorough and methodical with its pilot projects. The next phase of implementation should move more quickly as they are motivated to catch up to other countries in the region.\nWhile there are distinct companies operating independently within the power sector, they are mostly state run. A small amount of generation and some distribution is handled by private companies in rural regions. Oman has recently passed laws to expand privatization of these sectors.\nOman is a part of the Gulf Cooperation Council's (GCC) grid interconnection system, which allows for electricity transfers between the six connected countries (Kuwait, Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Oman). A 0.22 MW (220 kV) interconnection between the Oman (MIS) and UAE (Abu Dhabi) power systems has been commercially operational since 2012. While not used consistently, the link has provided emergency reserves on a number of occasions, preventing power failures in the MIS."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Oman is struggling with rising public debt. It has historically relied on oil revenue and is also not as rich as its neighbors. It has been significantly affected by the fall in oil prices and the country's credit rating has been downgraded in recent years. The centralized management by the government is relatively efficient at maneuvering these issues, while limited financial resources continue to fuel the investment scene. Financing for IPP projects is still available but more challenging to obtain than it was 3-4 years ago."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The Sultanate has recently decided to allow 100% foreign ownership of companies and property. Associated laws are expected to be enacted in 2019. In October 2018, the Sultanate launched a program to begin privatizing its electricity companies ' as much as 49% of the Oman Electricity Transmission Co. and up to 70% of associated distribution and supply companies.  For the region, Oman has a decent and relatively stable and open business environment. The current difficulty is the overall situation relating to public finances that is due to the price of oil. A very minor note is that Omani law requires salaries to increase at 3% annually so overseas investors must consider that in their business plans."}]}
