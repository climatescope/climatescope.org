In 2015, the Act Establishing the Public Electric Power Service (LOSPEE) was published, overseeing the power sector in Ecuador. Under this law, the National Electricity Board (CONELEC) becomes the Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL). While generation is open to private players in Ecuador, transmission is under the responsibility of state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC EP Transelectric). Distribution is divided between 11 majority-public companies, in which MEER is the majority shareholder. \nIn 2018, Ecuador had a total of 8.7GW of installed capacity, with hydro representing 50% and thermal power accounting for 39% of its mix. In 2016, the country doubled its hydro capacity, which totaled 4.4GW in 2018.

Ecuador also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions in the energy sector to a level between 37.5% and 45.8% below the BAU scenario by 2025. This additional reduction is conditioned upon availability of resources and international support."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Ecuador faces difficulties to deploy more renewable projects due to key characteristics of its power market. A combination of very low electricity tariffs, fossil fuel subsidies for electricity generation and low power demand growth produces a challenging environment for project developers.
