energy policy","value":"Ecuador does not have a clear target for renewables, despite claiming an interest to raise clean generation by 2025. The country had a 90% hydro target to be met by 2017, which it did not achieve, even after the addition of 2GW of hydro capacity in 2016. Ecuador, like many countries in the region, is heavily dependent on hydropower and exposed to variations of rainfall. The government gives priority of dispatch for biomass, geothermal, small hydro, solar, tidal and wind projects. Renewable energy developers may also apply for import tax exemption on clean energy equipment and a five-year waiver on income tax. Despite that, deployment of wind and solar assets have been minimal. Ecuador was one of the few countries in Latam to have a feed-in-tariff incentive for renewables, which is currently not in force."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investments in clean energy in Ecuador are very small. Since 2011, the total invested amounted to only $500 million, mainly in small hydro assets. Development banks Inter-American Investment Corporation and Corporación Andina de Fomento (CAF) are the biggest lead arrangers in the country, mainly investing in small hydro."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Since 2011, commercial, industrial and residential power prices have risen 33%, 58% and 8%. In 2017, average commercial, industrial and residential tariffs were $104.1/MWh, $94.6/MWh and $101.70/MWh, respectively. Ecuador has one of the lowest tariffs in Latin America, being in the bottom five."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In Ecuador, the Ministry of Electricity and Renewable Energy (MEER) oversees renewable energy policy and planning. In 2015, the Act Establishing the Public Electric Power Service (LOSPEE) was published, overseeing the power sector in Ecuador. Under this law, the National Electricity Board (CONELEC) becomes the Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL). While generation is open to private players in Ecuador, transmission is under the responsibility of state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC EP Transelectric). Distribution is divided between 11 majority-public companies, in which MEER is the majority shareholder. In 2017, Ecuador had a total of 8.2GW of installed capacity, with hydro representing 49% and thermal power accounting for 42% of its mix. In 2016, the country doubled its hydro capacity, which totals 3.9GW today. Clean energy, encompassing small hydro, biomass, wind and solar plants, represents 10% of total capacity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"On October 13, 2015, the Government of Ecuador submitted its unconditional Intended Nationally Determined Contribution (INDC) to the United Nations, committing to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in the energy sector by 20.4%-25% below the business as usual (BAU) scenario by 2025. Ecuador also committed to a further reduction of GHG emissions in the energy sector to a level between 37.5% and 45.8% below the BAU scenario by 2025. This additional reduction is conditioned upon availability of resources and international support."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Ecuador faces difficulties to deploy more renewable projects due to key characteristics of its power market. A combination of very low electricity tariffs and a low power demand produces a challenging environment for project developers. Currently, the country is able to meet peak power demand via its hydro capacity alone."}]}
