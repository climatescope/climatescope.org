faces barriers to the deployment of more renewable generation due to key characteristics of its power market.

From 2011 to 2017, the total invested amounted was only $489 million, mainly in small hydro assets. In 2018, the country did not receive any investment. In 2019, it attracted $100 million for wind projects.

The country did not achieve its 90% hydro target to be met by 2017, even with the addition of 2GW of hydro capacity in 2016. The government gives priority of dispatch for biomass, geothermal, small hydro, solar, tidal and wind projects. Renewable energy developers may apply for import tax exemption on clean energy equipment and a five-year waiver on income tax. Furthermore, on November 2018 the government introduced a net metering system, applicable for residential users with an installed capacity up to 300 kW of PV and industrial users with up to 500 kW. Despite that, deployment of wind and solar assets has been minimal. In 2019, the country launched a renewable auction for a 110MW wind portfolio and a solar PV project of 200MW. The Ministry of Energy received offers from Solarpack, Cobra Zero-E, Neoen and Total and intended to award concessions by year-end 2020.  The government also launched a tender for solar-plus-storage in the Galapagos Islands, aiming to reduce reliance on diesel generation.

Under this law, the National Electricity Board (CONELEC) becomes the Agency for Regulation and Control of Electricity (ARCONEL). While generation is open to private players in Ecuador, transmission is under the responsibility of state-owned utility Corporación Eléctrica del Ecuador (CELEC EP Transelectric). Distribution is divided between 11 majority-public companies, in which MEER is the majority shareholder. In 2019, Ecuador had a total of 8.6GW of installed capacity, with hydro representing 51% and thermal power accounting for 39% of its mix.
