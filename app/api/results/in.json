Auctioned capacity for solar and wind was at 19GW, a significant ramping up since 2017, as the country aims to reach 175GW of installed renewables by 2022. Wind capacity addition of 2.3GW in 2018 was 44% lower than 2017, partly due to a switch from feed-in tariffs to reverse auctions in early 2017. On the other hand, solar saw its best year-to-date with 9GW(AC) being installed in 2018 across utility-scale projects, rooftop solar and off-grid solar. Renewables policies have generally been stable but the government has had to balance competing objectives of achieving low tariffs, indigenization of the value chain and increasing the share of renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in India totaled $15.9 billion in 2018, with solar accounting for over 50%, followed closely by wind. This was 15% lower than 2017 as the costs of renewable energy projects continued to decline. BNEF tracked disclosed mergers and acquisitions deals of $2.8 billion in 2018 with a diverse mix of investors. The buyers include pension funds, domestic power producers, oil majors, Indian conglomerates, private equity firms and large foreign utilities. Initial public offerings though have taken a backseat as the major independent power producers such as Renew Power and Acme Solar Holdings have deferred plans after securing regulatory approval."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail electricity tariffs across the country for fiscal 2019 increased by just 1% on average from 2018, as two-thirds of the 18 major states did not make any changes to tariffs. Commercial and industrial consumers continue to cross-subsidize agricultural and residential users. Auction tariffs in 2018 did not set a new record low as borrowing costs rose, the rupee depreciated and developers factored in the difficulties of land acquisition. India still enjoys the lowest LCOE in the world for solar and third-lowest for wind."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"India's total installed power generation capacity was 356GW in April 2019 ' the third largest in the world ' with renewables (excluding large hydro) accounting for 77GW. Since 2017, the capacity additions from renewables have exceeded those of coal power generation. \nElectricity generation in India is a diversified mix of federally owned plants, state-owned plants and those owned by private companies. The transmission system comprises five interconnected regional grids, which are controlled by national and regional load dispatch centers. State-owned distribution companies have monopolies at the retail level with only a few cities, such as Delhi and Mumbai, having private operators.

In this period of eight years, the peak demand deficit dropped from 9.8% to 0.6% on the back of capacity addition ' mainly coal-fired plants. The Central Electricity Authority expects peak demand to jump to 226GW by March 2022, driven by population growth, the government's focus on ensuring 24x7 power for all, economic growth and the electrification of sectors such as transport. The power sector needs to undergo a rapid transformation to achieve the goal of 40% electricity generation from non-fossil fuels by 2030."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Land acquisition, transmission connectivity and offtaker risk are recurring challenges faced by developers in India. In 2018, the industry also faced macroeconomic headwinds on two fronts. First, the Indian rupee depreciated by 5% in nominal terms against the dollar. Auction tariffs are fixed for the entire duration of the power purchase agreement, in rupee terms, so the depreciation negatively affects all dollar-denominated payments. Second, a liquidity crunch in the banking sector led to increased borrowing costs. In July 2018, the government introduced a 2-year duty on solar cells and modules imported from China, Malaysia and developed countries. This was done to make domestic manufacturing cost-competitive and led to an increase in project costs."}]}
