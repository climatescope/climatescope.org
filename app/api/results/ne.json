energy policy","value":"An import duty exemption for renewable energy components, passed in September 2017, stands alone as Niger’s only piece of legislation explicitly designed to incentivize the rollout of clean power generation. Tenders for renewables projects have been issued since 2016, laying the groundwork for a first push toward meeting the official target of increasing the national share of renewable energy to 27% by 2020. It is worth noting, however, that this target includes large hydro. The government is also aiming to connect 15% of the population to off-grid renewables by 2020. The projects that are under way could make significant headway toward meeting these goals, but a lack of commissioned renewables plants and the short time remaining mean they are unlikely to be met on time."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"As domestic banks do not fund renewables projects, finance has largely come from foreign donors. The EU and AFD have joined forces on two such undertakings, spending a combined 28.5 million euros ($33 million) on a 20MW solar plant at Gorou Banda and 32 million euros on a 19MW solar-diesel plant in Agadez. The World Bank launched the National Solar Electricity Access Project (NESAP) in March 2018, funding it over six years to the tune of $50 million. Other noteworthy funders include the African Development Bank and the Islamic Development Bank, both of which have long underwritten domestic energy projects. Further renewables deployment is to come, with 50MW of projects announced by Nigelec, the national utility."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Niger relies heavily on imports from Nigeria to meet its energy needs, paying roughly 20,000 CFA/MWh ($33.88/MWh, based on the average 2017 exchange rate). The cost of electricity imports is set to rise dramatically in the near future due to the progressive privatization of Nigerian large hydro generation assets across the border. The Nigerien Ministry of Mines and Energy is bracing itself for what could amount to a threefold price increase. The output of Sonichar, a 69% state-owned company which operates the two 18MW coal plants that power the north’s extractive industry, is procured at around 65,000 CFA/MWh ($110.11/MWh). Retail rates are subsidized, with a social tariff introduced in 2012. Prices increased slightly in January 2018."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nigelec is vertically integrated except in power generation, which was opened up to IPPs in 2016. The only independent producer procured from is Sonichar, the aforementioned coal plant operator. Demand is currently met through energy imports from Nigeria. The total amount of power imported in 2017 is nearly double that generated domestically. Most of Niger’s diesel generators spend much of the year idle, only being powered up when transmission from its southern neighbor is interrupted. While several solar projects are being carried out, investment in non-renewable generation is set to continue alongside work on the Kandadji dam, a 130MW project bedeviled by repeated delays, in addition to the ongoing construction of a 600MW coal plant."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Future demand will be driven by the country’s continuing electrification. Alongside similar initiatives, the World Bank’s NESAP is expected to make considerable progress in raising what is among the world’s lowest access rate – Nigelec hopes to double its coverage over the next five years. Yet the historically slow rate of progress in this area leaves off-grid renewables well-suited to bringing electricity to rural areas. There is no national modernization program for the country’s power fleet, with ailing thermal plants and generators being repaired as they break down. The government is eager to push the development of renewables due to twin prospects of increasing Nigerian electricity costs and trading through the West African Power Pool, which is to be fully operational in 2020."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Security concerns present a considerable challenge and weaken the market’s attractiveness to investors. Project costs increase dramatically outside of Niamey’s immediate vicinity. A lack of domestically based companies involved in the renewables sector must also be surmounted. The dearth of human resources extends to the public sector, with administrative capacity nearing breaking point as the relevant government bodies struggle to cope with a growing pipeline of projects. Moreover, the general business climate is far from clement, with Niger ranking 144th on the World Bank’s Ease of Doing Business survey. That said, donors report that such hurdles as licensing progress swiftly once a project is given the go-ahead by the authorities."}]}
