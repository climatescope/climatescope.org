energy policy","value":"Thailand is the regional leader in total installed renewable capacity in Southeast Asia (SEA). It was the first country in SEA to implement a feed-in premium intended to spur investment and development of renewable energy projects. The generous feed-in premium and subsequent feed-in tariff programs implemented by the government successfully supported the growth of the renewables industry. By the end of 2018, cumulative installed solar capacity totaled 2.8GW and wind capacity slightly exceeded 1GW. The latest power development plan covering 2018-2037 targets an additional 18.6GW of renewable capacity in the next 20 years, with solar accounting for most of the addition, at 10GW. The country's Alternative Energy Development Plan (AEDP) is currently under revision."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Stimulated by the attractive feed-in premium, also known as the 'adder', introduced in 2007, renewable energy capacity has grown significantly. Within two years of the release of the 2015 Power Development Plan (PDP), Thailand had achieved almost half of its 2036 renewable energy capacity target. Among all technologies, solar accounts for majority of the growth. In its infancy, there were concessional financing programs from the Clean Technology Fund, Asian Development Bank and International Finance Corp. Over the years, Thailand's conglomerates actively participated in the development of renewable energy projects. Local commercial banks have supported the energy transition in Thailand, and have actively financed projects in the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Thailand's retail tariffs consist of a base tariff that is reviewed every three to five years and an adjustment tariff component that is reviewed every four months. The adjustment tariff reflects changes in fuel costs, electricity purchase cost and the impact of government policies. The costs of various renewable energy schemes are passed through to retail consumers and have contributed to an increase in retail tariffs over the years. Compared to neighboring countries such as Malaysia and Vietnam, retail tariffs in Thailand are higher. A drop in equipment costs globally, the establishment of domestic equipment production bases and a reduction in development and balance-of-plant costs as developers gained experience, have all contributed to a constant decline in the levelized cost of electricity for solar and wind in Thailand."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Thailand's power market is partially liberalized, with the generation sector opened up to the participation from private players. State-owned utility EGAT is the sole offtaker of all generated electricity. The introduction of Small Power Producers (SPPs) and Very Small Power Producers (VSPPs) promoted the decentralization of power generation utilizing renewable energy. In 2018, renewables, including large hydro, accounted for 18% of total domestic electricity generation. Natural gas is still the backbone of Thailand's power system, accounting for 60% of 2018's electricity generation. The latest power development plan of Thailand shows a further step back from coal and an increased role for gas in the power mix."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Thailand has achieved 100% electrification. In the 2018 PDP, total electricity demand is forecast to increase at an average growth rate of 3.2% over the period 2018-36. Year-on-year percentage growth is expected to decrease. Average growth is estimated to be 3.9% over the period 2019-22, and drop to 3% for 2023-37. This is partly due to an expected increase in energy efficiency. To boost the development of the renewable energy industry, Thailand's Board of Investment has exempted such projects from import tariffs. The investment climate in Thailand is stable. There are no known defaults by the single offtaker, EGAT. The grid in Thailand is also relatively robust, with a few instances of supply interruptions and no known curtailment. There are no barriers to entry in the form of foreign ownership restrictions or local content requirements."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Thailand's power generation market is open to foreign investment. Development activities in power projects were on hold pending the revision of the PDP over the last two years. The latest PDP 2018 introduced an export tariff for residential rooftop solar, opening up opportunities in the small-scale PV sector. As much as 2.7GW of utility-scale floating solar projects are also in the pipeline. However, most of the capacity addition is planned for after 2025, limiting opportunities in the next few years."}]}
