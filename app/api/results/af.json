energy policy","value":"Afghanistan's renewable energy policy targets the development of 4.5GW-5GW of capacity by 2032. The policy is divided into two terms - Term 1 (2015-2020) which aims at creating a favorable environment for the growth of the renewables sector and Term 2 (2020-2032) which will actually achieve the capacity targets. Going by current growth, the targets are very ambitious, given that the Term 1 deadline is coming up in just two years. There are no feed-in tariffs, subsidies or rules and regulations for the renewable energy sector - all these were a part of Term 1 goals but there hasn't been any success in achieving them."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"All the renewable energy projects in the country have been supported by international donors. The World Bank and the Asian Development Bank have been the biggest contributors. There has not been much private sector involvement. The majority of investments have been made in the hydropower sector and although there are large plans to expand solar, nothing has come to fruition yet. Term 1 had set goals to provide incentives such as interest subsidies, soft loans, tax exemptions, etc. to increase private sector participation: this will need to happen before the end of 2020 to stay in line with the targets set."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The electricity prices in Afghanistan are highly volatile because the country relies heavily on electricity imports to meet its needs. Over the last few years, because of appreciation of the U.S. dollar against Afghani, the national utility has hiked prices. Afghanistan, on an annual basis, pays more than $200 million to buy electricity from its neighboring countries. The utility however believes that once the country is able to harness its own resources, the prices will come down again."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Afghanistan relies heavily on imports. About 80% of the total generation capacity is imported, with the majority of demand being met by hydroelectricity. It is estimated that the country has the potential to generate 318GW of electricity from renewable sources with 23GW from hydro, 67GW from wind, 222GW from solar and 2GW from geothermal. So far, only parts of hydroelectric projects have been implemented. Da Afghaninstan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) is a government-owned utility that controls the power market, with little participation from the private sector. Policies are in place to increase the role of the private sector and create a favorable atmosphere for corporate power purchase agreements."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand for Afghanistan is largely met by imports. The demand is only expected to rise in the future but imports are not a reliable source to meet the electricity needs, mainly because of the political instability of the exporters. Some policies have been set in place to harness the country's potential to exploit its own hydroelectric, solar and wind resources. There has been progress in the increasing the electrification rates within the country: rural electrification now stands at 85.9% and urban electrification at 98%."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The energy sector faces issues such as funding gaps, lack of expertise, lack of reliable historical data, weak public awareness about environmental issues, high interest rates (almost 15% percent as compared to less than 5% in European countries) and security concerns, which result in high premiums for installing and commissioning projects. Moreover, DABS charges almost four times more for electricity produced through off-grid plans because of higher generation costs. In addition, there is no obligation to purchase the electricity. This discourages the use of off-grid electricity and increases offtaker risk."}]}
