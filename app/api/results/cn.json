energy policy","value":"TThe world's largest power market is undergoing a series of changes that will impact both generation and retail. For renewable energy, generous feed-in tariffs that were the norm for much of the past decade are coming to an end. Build out of subsidy-free capacity and competitive auctions to allocate the remaining subsidy will be the two separate tracks driving new build in 2019 and 2020, after which subsidies are likely to be completely eliminated. Retail liberalization now allows wind and solar assets to sell power ' albeit for a short duration of less than a year ' directly to large-end users. A renewed push for the 'prosumer' (producer+consumer) model will allow 1.6GW of distribution-grid-connected projects to serve neighboring loads."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"China's decade long clean energy investment growth rally was interrupted in 2018 as major policy revamps slowed the speed of wind and solar installations. As the market awaits new policies, the first half of 2019 saw a further 39% dip in renewable energy investment to $28.8 billion, the lowest figure for any half-year period since 2013. BloombergNEF expects the solar auction in July to lead to a rush of new PV project financing, as well as several large offshore wind deals in the second half, to lift investment. Overall, China's clean energy investments are likely to stabilize, if not decline slightly, in the coming years on the back of stable new wind and solar installations."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"China has some of the cheapest residential electricity in the world because it is subsidized by commercial and industrial (C&I) users. It began, in 2016, to address this cross-subsidization by lowering retail C&I power costs. China's Premier announced the target to reduce retail C&I tariffs by another 10% in 2019, after the same mandate last year, in order to benefit the manufacturing sector and lift the economy against the backdrop of trade tensions with the U.S. Levelized costs of solar and wind power have dropped significantly on the back of efficiency improvements and oversupply '  the solar policy change in 2018 triggered a 30% module price drop. Subsidy-free projects for both technologies have appeared in 16 provinces."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal still dominates China's power system, accounting for 53% of capacity and 64% of generation in 2018. The two numbers are already almost 10 percentage points down from just a year ago, demonstrating the speed of change. Wind and solar together now account for 19% of capacity and almost 8% of generation. Generation from renewables continues to grow, not only due to growth in capacity, but also reduction in curtailment. China's grid companies have deployed multiple approaches to incorporate more renewables, including generation rights trading, expanded inter-regional power transfer, thermal generator flexibility retrofits and spinning reserves reduction. The result is historically low national average curtailment rates of 4.7% for wind and 2.4% for solar in 1H 2019."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"China's power demand grew 8.5% year-on-year in 2018, to 6,845 TWh. Growth in 1H 2019 narrowed noticeably to 5%, largely due to trade tensions. Despite that, the energy transition and electrification of transport, heating, industrial processes, etc. are long-term policy goals that will continue to bolster demand. Investing in renewable energy will be subject to new challenges in navigating the relatively opaque auctions that often do not disclose timeline, volume caps, or grid capacity, which is the key limiting factor."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"China's strong local manufacturing capacity for wind and solar leaves little space for overseas players to compete. Many auctions only accept bids from companies with a significant track record in China. The government is opening up more segments of the energy sector ' such as the distribution grid and electric vehicles ' for domestic private and foreign investment. Even though the escalating trade war with the U.S. looms large on growth, its impact on China's wind and solar developments, batteries and electric vehicles has been limited. Yet it remains a question where in the liberalizing retail power market the incumbent grid companies will allow competition. They have opposed the 'prosumer' reforms since late 2017. New pilots announced in 2019 in 26 cities renew hope, though progress is still slow."}]}
