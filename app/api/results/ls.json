energy policy","value":"The Lesotho Energy Policy (2015-2025) provides a strategy for the energy sector but has not been formally adopted, creating uncertainty over the status and plan for the sector. A draft renewable energy framework policy has also been developed, including mechanisms for procuring both off-grid and on-grid renewable energy, but this has not yet been adopted either, adding to an uncertain investment climate. There are no specific regulations for off-grid renewables deployment. The country has set ambitious electricity-access targets of 40% of the population by 2020, renewable energy being one of the main tools proposed to achieve this."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Some 90MW of renewables are under development, with power offtake agreements in place. The 20MW NEO1 Solar project has been financed by the African Development Bank/World Bank, and the 70MW NEO2 Solar project has been financed and developed by the China's Exim bank. If they are completed, they will more than double Lesotho's fleet size. Lesotho's current installed capacity features 76MW of hydro, so it will retain a fleet that is 100% carbon free."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices are extremely high in Lesotho. They were $0.77 per KWh in 2018, on a weighted-average basis. Prices are elevated substantially by the need to procure imports from South Africa, which cost more than 10 times as much as domestically produced electricity. A growing domestic fleet, so one with low marginal cost electricity, should help reduce local power prices."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2018, Lesotho imported 30% of its power from neighboring South Africa. While its domestic fleet is composed entirely of hydro, South Africa's grid is composed of 90% coal power. Between its domestic production and imports, Lesotho's average carbon intensity is about 0.218 CO2 kg/KWh. Expansion of its domestic fleet with renewable energy will diminish import volumes and lower the carbon footprint of the power sector. The country has a strong financial incentive to do so, as imported electricity costs 10 times as much as domestically produced power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Data indicates that Lesotho's electrification rate has advanced from 17% in 2015 to almost 30% by 2018. Lestho's energy-access goals stipulate continued growth toward 50% by 2020, and 80% by 2030. This would provide a substantial opportunity for investment in the power sector."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Confusion is created by a number of overlapping energy-sector entities, including the Department of Energy, Lesotho Electricity Co., Lesotho Energy and Water Authority and Rural Electrification Unit, which results in an underdeveloped regulatory framework, a lack of equipment technical standards and ultimately slow implementation of energy-sector projects. There is also limited availability of suitable land for renewable energy development ' the terrain is mountainous and access is difficult, and where it is accessible it is often already being used for agriculture of settlement."}]}
