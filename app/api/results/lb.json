some regards, barriers to renewable investment in Lebanon remain low; so far, no tenders have stipulated local-content requirements, there are no restrictions on foreign investment, and renewable energy equipment does not attract import duties or tariffs (but it is subject to Lebanese sales tax). The country has some manufacturing capacity, but most renewables equipment will likely still be imported. In contrast to this, considerable red tape surrounds the current IPP tendering procedures and political considerations can increase the time taken to reach decisions. Finally, offtaker risk could be considerable, given the poor financial situation of EDL, in addition to curtailment risks in the form of transmission and distribution constraints in the underfunded grid."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The current pipeline of renewables projects will ensure strong growth in the sector in Lebanon. The country’s first PPA for a 226MW of wind project was signed in February 2018 at a price of $113/MWh. The Ministry of Environment and Water was the main signatory, and state utility Electricite du Liban (EDL) provided access through a letter of credit signed by the central bank of Lebanon. An additional 180MW of solar capacity, launched through a tender in 2017, is progressing toward signing PPA agreements. A further 700MW of solar-and-storage and wind projects could sign PPAs in the coming years as a result of future tender rounds. The Lebanese Centre for Energy Conservation received considerable expressions of interest for its tenders, including both from local and major international developers such as ACWA Power, First Solar and Tesla, amongst others. Investment in the first round of auctions has come mostly from domestic sources. IRENAs Lebanon Renewable Energy Outlook, 2020, estimates that around $2.2 billion of investment is needed to develop the renewables sector to reach Lebanon’s ambitious targets."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Lebanon is aiming for a 30% share of renewables in final energy consumption by 2030. The target was proposed in 2018 and adopted by the Lebanese government in 2019. Lebanon has made some movements toward this target, guided by the country’s National Renewable Energy Action Plan, which was released in 2016. Yet, administrative bottlenecks, fiscal woes, Covid-19 challenges and a lack of government have drawn some of the focus away from Lebanon’s renewable-energy sector.  So far, just one 226MW wind project has signed a PPA. Two additional PV tenders are under way; one for 180MW of solar capacity and another for three 100 MW solar-plus-storage projects. A 400MW wind tender was also under instruction as of September 2020. Government support for renewables is uncertain – in August 2020 the Lebanese government stepped down in the wake for the Beirut port explosion.  Lack of investment and frequent blackouts that plague the power sector are unlikely to be addressed soon."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Lebanon’s power demand is difficult to estimate because much of it is unmet or provided by the fleet of black-market diesel generators. In recent years, an estimated 500MW of additional demand has come from the 1.5 million Syrian refugees present in the country. Forecast demand growth is modest. However, significant investment is required before current demand can be met. Lebanon enjoys high electrification rates and has few off-grid developments, although this sector represents opportunities to reduce dependence on the chronically unreliable grid. In terms of natural resources, Lebanon has abundant solar potential, which IRENA estimates to be around 182GW. Studies have also suggested wind potential between 1.5GW to 6GW of capacity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"EDL has a monopoly on transmission and distribution as well as retail of electricity. Any reforms to EDL or the power market are unlikely in the current political situation. Diesel and heavy-fuel generation dominate Lebanon’s power mix in the form of ageing plants, leased power ships, or illegal private generators. The country imports some electricity from the Syrian interconnector. The law authorizing IPPs is still pending implementation; however, an exceptional decree granting the executive temporary powers to license new projects, which was introduced in 2014 and extended for three years in April 2019, has made the current pipeline of projects possible."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The government subsidizes electricity prices in the form of cheap diesel and heavy fuel oil for the state utility, Electricite du Liban (EDL), which sells electricity to the grid significantly below its cost of generation. Electricity retail tariffs have been frozen since the 1990s and this has put a massive strain on public finances. Yet, any movement toward more cost-reflective power prices remains politically untenable. Generation capacity is well below consumer demand. EDL’s inability to meet electrical demand has spawned a large fleet of private diesel generators. These supply the grid during the daily blackouts, which may last three hours in Beirut and up to 12 hours in rural areas. Despite their illegality, these generators contribute an estimated 23% of all electricity and provide electricity at more than double the cost a typical EDL tariff. EDL also faces losses from technical issues and unpaid bills. Losses represent 43% of EDL’s production. Some 17% of these are technical losses (such as transmission constraints and grid conjestion), 21% are non-technical losses (meter tampering, misbilling and theft), and 5% are losses from uncollected bills. The PPA for the first round of wind auctions was at $113/MWh. The LCOE of solar PV in Lebanon will likely be competitive in the context of the country’s diesel-dominated power sector. By the end of 2018, small-scale PV solutions totaled around 60MW, with more in development as solar costs continue to drop. A project funded by the National Council for Scientific Research estimated that rooftop PV in Beirut could provide up to a third of the capital’s electricity needs."}]}
