energy policy","value":"Cameroon has committed to secure 25% electricity generation from renewable sources by 2035, as part of its nationally determined contribution (NDC). In 2017, the share was less than 4.5%. The government aims to formalize this target through a renewable energy law, which would introduce a mandatory auction or tendering process, set renewable electricity purchase tariffs, and clarify the rules around the purchase of renewable electricity. No draft has been announced as of yet. The only effective support for renewables developers in Cameroon is that equipment benefits from VAT exemptions. Other fiscal incentives, such as import duty waivers, are not consistently implemented. The utility, Eneo, has begun to procure tenders for solar."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Hydro projects have been the largest recipient of clean energy investment in Cameroon, with 5GW either announced or secured financing as of September 2018. Some small-scale solar projects have also closed financing in recent years, particularly for rural electrification, but investment in MW-scale projects has yet to gain traction. Cameroon is open to private finance. The biggest investors have been international organizations such as the World Bank, which financed $784.5 million in 2018 for the Nachtigal hydropower project. Investors from China, including firms such as Eximbank, are active in Cameroon’s hydro and solar sectors."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The Electric Sector Regulation Agency (ARSEL) sets the electricity tariffs, which are relatively high for the region, particularly for a hydro-dominated market, owing to high transmission costs (including grid distribution losses of about 30%). The government subsidizes the tariffs by transferring funds to the monopoly utility, Eneo, paying some $20.6 million over 2012-18. Hydro remains Cameroon’s cheapest source of electricity, but recent growth in small-scale and off-grid solar suggest these are becoming increasingly competitive in rural areas away from the three separate power grids. Grid operators must buy excess production from renewables installations, but no price is specified and they may not buy electricity at above-market rates, limiting the policy’s effectiveness."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Hydro dominates the capacity mix, followed by fossil fuels. Cameroon was one of the first in Africa to open its electricity sector to private-sector participation, and in 2001, AES became majority shareholder of the utility (then called Sonel). A new reform phase began in 2011 with the unbundling of generation, transmission and distribution. Sonel was acquired by Actis in 2014, and rebranded as Eneo. A 2015 decree split the transmission and system operation components to create the state-owned Sonatrel, which decides dispatch and is a single buyer for grid-connected generation. Eneo dominates generation, but two IPPs operate the two main thermal plants. The legal framework for electricity needs significant review, which will likely begin after the October 2018 elections."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Cameroon has seen average economic growth of 3.7% a year over the last decade but it has slowed recently owing to falling revenue from oil, rubber and coffee production. The country has a relatively weak electrification rate of 54%, with less than 30% in rural areas. The government aims to reach 3GW of power capacity by 2020, mainly through new hydropower plants, and off-grid solar in rural areas. The Rural Electrification Master Plan, in its second phase, aims to electrify 10,000 locations by 2035, securing 50,000 connections annually over 20 years. The government is also preparing a new framework to regulate private off-grid renewables projects, although the policy’s legal status is unclear."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier to private-sector participation is the extent of Eneo's concession for generation, which limits those who can produce electricity in a given area. Another barrier is the inconsistent implementation of import duties for renewables, as Cameroon does not have an import tariff waiver. Equally, the government’s prioritization of the development of hydro resources has impeded solar deployment, which has been seen as too expensive. Of the 792MW of solar in Cameroon’s project pipeline, just one megawatt-scale plant (Huawei’s 20MW solar microgrid) has secured financing. Concerns over the impact of dry seasons on hydropower availability have, however, resulted in the government considering alternatives including some demand response in the capital, Douala."}]}
