absence of clear regulations makes it very hard for solar developers to connect rooftop projects to the grid. Without any regulations on net metering, feed-in tariffs or export tariffs, only behind-the-meter projects with 100% self-consumption are possible. There is a hesitance to move forward with appropriate policy measures on EDC’s side as the grid itself is old and not smart, and probably cannot handle a large number of intermittent small-scale resources. For utility-scale renewables, it can be difficult to obtain a generation license, which is required to export power to the grid, unless renewables can offer competitive prices."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Like its neighbor Laos, Cambodia has directed power sector investment towards large hydro and coal-fired power plants, as well as transmission and distribution, to support electrification. Non-hydro renewables investment has been slower to take off. However, a drought in 2019 that caused wide-spread blackouts for months in a row, and growing power demand, made the government change direction. In February 2019, a 100MW solar tender kicked off. Grid-connected solar capacity has reached 150MW as of April 2020. More solar and onshore wind projects are in the pipeline. The investment in solar is expected to increase rapidly in the coming years. There are few Cambodian banks or other financial institutions with the ability to support renewable energy projects at present, although some small banks, with assistance from Japanese parent companies, are hoping to increase the availability of domestic financing with capacity building."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Cambodia has a limited number of clean energy policies in place today, and there are no incentives such as feed-in tariffs or net metering which could support residential or commercial solar. The Asian Development Bank has been working with Electricité Du Cambodge (EDC) – the national utility that controls most of the grid and retails power to all grid-connected consumers – to help launch a pilot solar auction to procure 100MW. On February 13, 2019, the EDC invited bids for the first leg of the auction: a 60MW project in Kampong Chhnang province. EDC has been allowing more solar projects to connect to the grid since then. The Blue Circle is working on Cambodia’s first-ever onshore wind project of 80MW."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The government’s aggressive electrification program has raised the share of households with access to electricity from 22% in 2010 to a reported 75% in 2019, boosting demand for power five-fold. The quality of electricity supply remains an issue in remote areas, but opportunities for off-grid companies are thin: the government is not transparent about grid extension plans, and off-grid systems are unable to feed into the grid once it arrives, effectively stranding these assets. The country is making an effort to expand renewable energy projects by floating tenders. There is steady progress in  solar installations despite a lack of financial incentives."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Cambodia’s power market is dominated by EDC. Nearly all of the generators are owned by independent power producers, which can sell to EDC only via a special license. In remote areas of the country, electricity is supplied by hundreds of private operators that generate, deliver and sell power. These operators however lose their licenses to generate power as soon as the national grid arrives. In 2019, 25% of Cambodia's electricity was imported from Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos. Large hydro and coal-fired plants account for about 90% of the domestic power generation. Most of these units have been built since 2012 to support its growing demand."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Cambodia’s consumers pay some of the highest retail electricity rates in the region, at $0.14/kWh for residential consumers. These are higher than in its neighboring nations such as Vietnam and Thailand. These tariffs have declined by roughly 20% since 2015, as the government has sought to make power more affordable as it connects more villages to the grid. Tariffs are not cost-reflective but are subsidized by the government, which covers losses faced by electricity distributors. Because of the focus on rapid electrification and lowering costs, EDC and the government have favored large power plants with low per-megawatt costs, such as hydro and coal."}]}
