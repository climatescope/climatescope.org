energy policy","value":"Albania's national electricity target for clean energy is 38% of demand by 2020. Given its reliance on hydropower and a paucity of planned solar or wind projects, Albania's ability to meet this target is overly reliant on the unpredictable hydrological cycle. The country's 2017 National Renewable Energy Law seeks to incentivize solar, wind, and small hydro generation through feed-in tariffs. Self-generation incentives have been promised, but details are lacking in the absence of secondary legislation."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Small hydro draws mostly domestic investors, while large hydro draws international ones. Investment in solar and wind energy is discussed but to date little funding has actually been committed. The clean energy investment landscape in Albania is not enhanced by the number of speculative investors involved in small hydro projects. A secondary market thrives for licenses, generating paperwork and heavy turnover of development rights, but little actually gets built. \nThe government has announced plans to track development rights and withdraw licenses from speculators who don't appear to be on a path toward construction. If followed through on, those steps could potentially see more investment directed toward projects that are completed. The most notable instance of foreign investment in large hydro is the 73MW Banje power plant, owned by Statkraft of Norway. Albania's first solar auction awarded 100MW of capacity to a foreign investor, but progress on contract negotiation has been slow. There is no transparency on future auctions."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Albania does not have a power exchange, but plans to implement one have been undertaken. Consumers are split into two classes: residential customers and small- to medium-sized commercial enterprises are eligible to receive a regulated electricity tariff, while large consumers negotiate their own rates. The tariffs are re-stated annually, while OSHEE, the supplier of electricity for regulated tariff customers, is under pressure from the World Bank's loan covenants to reduce its debt burden, potentially by increasing prices."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Albania's power market is undergoing reform, which the government promised to the European Union in exchange for financial support under the Third Energy Package, legislation intended to open up gas and electric markets in the EU. Electricity generation is unbundled; transmission and distribution are not. State-owned KESH participates in generation along with independent power producers. State-owned OST, the transmission system operator, was granted membership into ENTSO-E, the European network of transmission operators pending verification of its unbundled status. As of 2018, this status has not been confirmed. The electricity distributor, OSHEE, is also not fully unbundled into an independent entity. \n\nAlbania's domestic generation is nearly 100% hydro-powered, and until 2017 the country was dependent on its neighbors for electricity imports because domestic sources were insufficient. Higher hydropower production in 2018 saw the country briefly become a net exporter of electricity."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Albania is seeking investment in its power sector, but its market is viewed as not yet mature enough to overcome perceived risk. Complete unbundling of the transmission and distribution sectors, along with the establishment of a power exchange, would go a long way toward addressing that perception. Control of most institutions remains with state-owned entities, and free market operations are slow to take off. Despite feed-in tariff contracts awarded to numerous developers to build small hydro facilities, most licenses are traded away. Large international investors seeking a lasting presence in the country are rare; Statkraft's presence is an exception. The most recently concluded auction for solar power was awarded to a consortium of international developers. However, with no reported local partner or presence, their long term success in the country is hard to determine."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Barriers to operating in the country include offtaker risk and the slow bureaucratic pace of operations. As part of power sector reform the distribution system operator and supplier of electricity for regulated tariff customers, OSHEE, will act as the offtaker for new renewable projects. It is restructuring under a loan from the World Bank to reduce its debt burden. Among the factors contributing to OSHEE's plight are low tariffs, electricity theft, and line losses in the distribution system. OSHEE's perilous financial position means that any power purchase agreements will most likely be signed in conjunction with one or several government or World Bank guarantees. While the levels of theft have reportedly gone down, the pace of progress on other fronts is slow."}]}
