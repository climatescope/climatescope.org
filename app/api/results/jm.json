energy policy","value":"Jamaica seeks to decrease its oil dependency and improve its energy security by diversifying its electricity mix. It was the Caribbean's first country to hold clean energy-only auctions. The country's National Energy Plan 2009-2030 calls for 20% of its electricity generation to come from renewable sources by 2030. Private utility Jamaica Public Service (JPS) has responsibility for generation, transmission, and distribution on the island (the government owns 20% of the company). Other players may enter the market as independent power producers (IPPs) and sell electricity to JPS."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Jamaica attracted $0.3 billion in new-build clean energy investment over 2010-18. Wind energy was responsible for the highest investment in this period ($180 million), followed by solar with $127 million. Wind investment peaked in 2015 due to renewable energy auctions."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Jamaica has the most expensive electricity in Latin America. In 2018, commercial electricity prices increased 28%, from $213.79/MWh in 2016 to $273.20/MWh. Industrial electricity prices rose 30% in 2018 compared to 2016, reaching $218.73/MWh.

Over 65% of it came from fossil fuel plants. Renewable energy (small hydro, solar and wind) accounted for roughly 8%. \nClean energy capacity started increasing in 2016, when auction-winning projects came online. Among the winners, wind plants with combined capacity of 60MW and one 20MW PV plant were commissioned in 2016. After 2016, just 2MW were added to solar capacity in 2018, reflecting on Jamaica's total installed capacity of 862MW.

Apart of that, Jamaica has not seen many important changes since the renewables auctions in 2015."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Clean energy in Jamaica is subject to many of the same barriers as other investments: corruption and crime that increase the cost of doing business and bureaucratic red tape. Apart of that, formal barriers to development of renewables in Jamaica are low. Consumers with their own generation facilities may participate in Jamaica Public Service's net metering pilot program. They receive JPS's avoided-cost rate plus 15% for electricity delivered to the national grid. As of May 2019, a total of 757 consumers with renewable energy self-generation facilities were connected to the grid. Jamaica collects no value added tax (VAT) for components needed to build a solar or wind project."}]}
