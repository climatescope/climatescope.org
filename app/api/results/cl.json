energy policy","value":"Brazil attracted almost $56 billion in new asset finance for clean energy plants in 2009-18, by far the largest amount in Latin America over the period. Wind alone accounts for 54% of the total, while solar attracted 8%. The solar share should increase as developers secured almost 2.5GW in contracts in the 2017-19 auctions. Brazilian national development bank BNDES has played a major role in the development of the country's renewable energy market. The bank is the top global lender to clean energy, having disbursed $23.5 billion for renewable energy projects (excluding large hydro) between 2009 and 2018. However, the bank had changed the methodology it uses to calculate interest rates. Those are now slated to increase gradually for new loans until 2023 when they reach par with commercial levels. Between now and then, we expect BNDES's contributions to fade somewhat as private capital takes a more prominent role."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Chile recorded $11 billion of clean energy investment from 2013 to year-end 2018. The 2018 level, however, was almost 60% less than the previous year. The country has many types of financial organizations investing in renewables, including development and commercial banks. The U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) has been the main lead arranger in the country. Although distributed PV generation expanded strongly in 2018 (from 12MW in 2017 to 24.3MW in 2018), the lack of cheap financing is an obstacle. In an attempt to boost distributed generation, the government expanded the size limit for installations from 100kW to 300kW in 2018. The number of installations decelerated in 2019, however."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"In Chile, spot prices are determined by the node of delivery, which takes into account the marginal operating costs of nodal plants as well as nodal demand. Wholesale prices have shown high volatility in recent years during the day. In 2018, wholesale prices slipped to zero at times during midday, while shooting back to $60/MWh at night. The same pattern was observed in previous years, but the situation has improved since the interconnection of the country's main power subsystems, SIC (Sistema Interconectado Central) and SING   (Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande). The tariff is based on peak load pricing, where consumers pay a price according to the demand. Average national commercial, industrial and residential tariffs rose slightly in 2018 to $224/MWh, $158/MWh and $197/MWh, respectively."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Chile has a National Electric System (Sistema Eléctrico Nacional, or SEN) as well as two smaller isolated systems in the south of the country, the Sistema Eléctrico de Aysén (SEA) and Sistema Eléctrico de Magallanes (SEM). SEN was created with the connection of the country's two primary power systems, the Sistema Interconectado del Norte Grande (SING) and the Sistema Interconectado Central (SIC), at the end of 2017. The process of interconnection is ongoing and the country commissioned a second line connecting the two systems in June 2019. The SIC and SING sub-systems together account for 99% of Chile's total installed capacity, with 18.4GW and 6.2GW installed, respectively. \nIn 2018, Chile had 2.3GW of solar and 1.5GW of wind capacity, representing 16% of total installed capacity, and renewable power represented 21% of all energy generated. Wind generation in Chile surged from 1.4TWh in 2014 to 3.5TWh in 2017, while solar output spiked from 0.5TWh to 5.1TWh. Together, wind and solar represented 11% of the country's total power generation in 2018, up from virtually nothing five years ago."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Chile is the world's largest copper exporter, and the energy-intensive nature of that industry creates substantial power demand. The copper industry alone accounted for nearly half of Chile's exports. In a given year, the mining industry consumes an average of 30% of the total power generated in the country. Mining operations are located in the northern part of the country and mostly served by the SING system. The majority of coal assets are also located in this region, in addition to the greatest potential for solar generation in the country. However, the lack of interconnection between SIC and SING has historically driven the majority of solar developments to the SIC system, where over 90% of the population lives and most of the retail demand is located. This reality might change, however, as the government increasingly focuses on integration of the two sub-systems."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The main barrier for renewables development remains insufficient interconnection between the two sub-systems. Interconnection is critical for enabling solar energy, in particular, produced in the northern SING sub-system and home to the best solar resources, to flow to the center of the country, where population and demand are concentrated. Curtailment of renewables began in Chile in August 2015. Since then, wind and solar power had been curtailed at increasing rates, though progress is being made on development of new transmission infrastructure aimed at easing this. Currently the country has only two transmission lines connecting SIC-SING operating at full capacity. The government aims to increase the flexibility of the grid to allow for better integration of the renewable intermittent sources."}]}
