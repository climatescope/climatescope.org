energy policy","value":"Nigeria has a target of 30GW of overall power generation capacity by 2030, of which 30% is expected to come from renewables, as set out in the Nigeria Vision 30-30-30 energy target policy. By 2030, the country plans to have 5.3GW of minigrids and 2.8GW of solar home systems, up from 1MW and 30MW in 2015, respectively. Self-generation, typically diesel, currently meets more than three-quarters of demand. The government wants to reduce this from 13.8GW to 5GW between 2015 and 2030. The challenging conditions to access the government feed-in tariffs and uncertainties around the distribution companies’ ability to pay, means that decentralized power generation projects offer the most direct opportunity in Nigeria today. The dedicated minigrid regulation that applies to all minigrids between 100kW and 1MW, whilst assets under this threshold remain unregulated, guarantees investors that they will be paid a full year of revenue plus their assets residual value should a distribution company ever electrify the area in which they operate."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"In 2016, some 14 solar utility-scale projects totaling 1.4GW signed PPAs with NBET (Nigerian Bulk Electricity Trading). NBET, the bulk trader, act as the middle man between generators and distributors, they buy power from generators via U.S. dollar-denominated power purchase agreements and sell that power to the distributors. In order to reach financial close, lenders require developers to obtain a so-called put-call option agreement (PCOA), a Ministry of Finance document guaranteeing that if a project defaults (due to the developer or NBET) the government will pay lenders the outstanding principal in full. In March 2018, the former Minister of Finance, Kemi Adeosun, said the PPA tariff agreed with NBET of 11.5 U.S. cents/kWh was too high and developers should accept 7.5 U.S. cents, so no PCOAs have been signed or approved yet. Some developers have told BNEF that since PV capex has fallen drastically, they may accept the lower tariff. One developer has said it will reach financial close as early as December 2018, so construction could start in early 2019."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Nigeria’s retail electricity prices are lower than most West-African countries, such as Ghana and Senegal, but higher than other parts of Africa, like South Africa and Zambia. The electricity prices are set by the Nigerian Electricity Regulatory Commission in the so-called multi-year tariff order (MYTO) model. The tariffs are cost-reflective and are derived using an LCOE-approach. The MYTO is reviewed every five years and sets out the retail power prices for five years ahead. Given the recent activity with the on-grid solar projects, the tariff of 7.5-11.5 cents/kWh falls within the range of our global solar LCOEs. Currently there is no wholesale power market in Nigeria, instead NBET works as the middle-man/broker between generators and distributors."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"At year-end 2017, Nigeria had installed electricity capacity of 13GW, of which 15.1% was large hydro, 0.5% small-hydro and 84.4% fossil fuels. Only 7.5GW of the installed capacity is actually available, and just 4GW are available on average during the year. Nigeria is currently trying to create an enabling environment that will lead to an increase of grid capacity. Nigeria’s target of 30% renewables by 2030 would require a change in its energy mix, though as yet it has no commissioned on-grid renewables capacity. Nigeria imports less than 2% of its power from other countries. Following an extensive power market reform a few years ago, generation is fully privatized, transmission is still government-owned, while distribution is privatized, but with only 11 players allocated by region."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"In 2016 alone, Nigerians spent $16 billion to power private diesel and gasoline generators, with more than 60% of companies having access to, or significantly relying on, generators, compared to less than 20% in South Africa. The potential for minigrids in Nigeria is substantial: a recent A.I. study has identified as many as 10,000 possible minigrid sites. That compares with GIZ's estimate of 4,000. In addition, the minigrid regulation Nigeria has in force since 2016, though not perfect yet, it arguably giving minigrid developers greater confidence. Nigeria’s strongest clean energy resource is solar (4-6.5 kWh/m2/day irradiation) followed by small-hydro (as much as 3.5GW)."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The import duty rate varies between 0% and 30% of the purchase value. PV modules without a bypass diode do not pay any 0% duty whilst those that have one pay a 5% charge plus 5% VAT. As the vast majority of modules come shipped with a bypass diodes that allows for a more stable generations, developers have complained that the duty exemption is redundant. Lithium-ion batteries, even if used for energy storage, are slapped with a 20% duty on import plus 5% VAT. The other major barrier is currency convertibility risks. Due to the restrictions on foreign currency by the CBN, international developers and lenders are worried about investing in the Nigerian power sector. Whether denominated in U.S. dollars or not, energy tariffs in Nigeria are paid in naira, raising currency convertibility issues – while awaiting supply of hard currency, the naira can weaken, eating into potential profits. As a result, the market is dominated mostly by local players more comfortable with holding naira."}]}
