energy policy","value":"Sri Lanka recently approved a long-term electricity generation plan (2020-2039) which includes new coal plants, the preferred option of the utility Ceylon Electricity Board, and also envisages new gas and renewable energy plants, which is what the regulator Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka or PUCSL favored. The new generation plan increased the proportion of renewables and decreased the proportion of coal slightly, while doubling gas capacity compared to the last plan submitted in 2018. This indicates that gas might be what the country would settle for to balance interests of different parties. Sri Lanka's grid is isolated - having no connections with any of its neighbors yet - which also impacts future planning."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Unlike any other country in South Asia, Sri Lanka has 100% electrification. New power plants are required to meet growing demand, and also to balance retirements. The island nation of about 20 million people has a large base of small hydro plants, is expanding wind and solar installations, and piloting newer technologies such as geothermal and wave energy. Multilateral lenders like Asia Development Bank (ADB) and International Finance Corporation are active in the market, lending funds and providing technical assistance. Some of the recent smaller-sized solar projects bid out are aimed at giving the local entrepreneurs an opportunity in this sector."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Sri Lanka has among the highest tariffs in the world for residential users (45 rupees/ 28 U.S. cents), which partly explains the rapid uptake of rooftop solar in households. Industrial and commercial segment tariffs are lower. Tariffs have not been revised since 2014."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The Sri Lankan market is a long way away from liberalization. Ceylon Electricity Board, the dominant utility, is yet to be unbundled, and seems at odds with the regulator PUCSL. Besides their differences on the ideal long-term generation mix for the country, the regulator is unhappy with the delays in new plant construction by the utility. Resorting to oil-fired emergency power is not only expensive, but also extremely polluting. The PUCSL has not announced any retail tariff revisions since 2014. CEB has not been able to make a convincing case for tariff revision, transparently laying out its power procurement and power sales."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Rooftop solar is a bright spark in renewable energy in Sri Lanka. The availability of a net metering scheme coupled with high tariffs means that more and more rooftops are aiming for solar installations. ADB provided loans worth $50 million to 100 thousand entrepreneurs to build rooftop solar projects in 2018. Import of equipment for renewable energy is exempt from the national building tax (NBT) and as well as the ports and airport levy (PAL)."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A host of pilot projects described as \"exotic technologies\" are in the pipeline: large-scale battery storage, ocean energy, small wind power vertical-type systems and hybrid power systems combining solar, wind and battery. Though the aspirational target of 100% clean energy is often cited, the fact is that new coal plants are part of the new long-term energy plan. With its limited area, and population, Sri Lanka could be an ideal market for electric vehicles. The budget offers some tax exemptions for setting up EV charging stations, even as a plan for electrifying mobility is being worked on."}]}
