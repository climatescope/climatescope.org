energy policy","value":"Taiwan’s feed-in tariffs have supported the growth of renewable energy to reach 7.8GW of capacity by end-2017. The new administration, which came to power in 2016, launched an aggressive energy transition plan to phase out nuclear by 2025 while adding 25GW of renewables. Lucrative offshore wind feed-in tariffs have attracted major European developers; but given the two previous PPA renegotiations between Taipower and independent power producers in the early 2010s, financiers are wary of possible offtaker risk. Though the government is expected to allocate targeted capacities, including through offshore wind and utility-scale solar auctions, difficulties in land acquisition for solar and an immature wind supply chain can be significant roadblocks to deliver projects on time to meet goals."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Solar has so far attracted most of the clean energy investment in Taiwan though investment in wind is poised to grow fast, largely because the government auctioned off 5.5GW of offshore capacity in 2018. Taiwan local banks have lent to solar projects, but are still becoming comfortable with the nascent offshore wind sector. As a result, early offshore wind deals have been led by foreign banks. International commercial financing may continue to play an important role through project finance and local green bond issuance."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Taiwan has some of the world’s cheapest retail power prices, a deliberate government policy to benefit semiconductor and other economy-driving manufacturing industries. In 2017, the residential tariff was the third lowest and the industrial tariff the sixth lowest, according to Taipower and the International Energy Agency. The utility raised the average retail tariff by 3% in April 2018 for the first time in four years; industry and large commercial companies will feel the brunt of the increase, while 80% of residents and small businesses are not affected. Adding new and more expensive renewables and gas generation will further stress Taipower's balance sheet as the cost cannot be fully passed on to end-consumers."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Coal accounted for nearly half of Taiwan’s power generation in 2017. This leading position is set to change with the government’s energy transition to increase the share of gas power to 50% and renewables to 20% of total generation by 2025 while phasing out nuclear power, which accounted for 8% in 2017. To spur accelerated growth, policies have been introduced to give renewable energy priority dispatch and permission to be sold directly to end-users on the unregulated market. Fossil fuel generators can only sell power to Taipower – the vertically integrated utility that owned 80% of the island’s total power capacity at the end of 2017 – but liberalization for thermal generators is due to take effect in 6-9 years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Taiwan’s power demand is only expected to grow modestly at 1.6% in the next two decades, according to Taiwan Research Institute. Yet the government’s intention to take all of the 5.1GW nuclear power capacity offline by 2025 creates opportunities for renewable energy. The island has been receptive to foreign players, granting three-quarters of the 3.8GW offshore wind capacity announced in April 2018 to overseas developers. The government is also working with global supply chain companies to establish a local offshore wind manufacturing hub. Overseas banks have also actively participated in project financing."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Regulators do not allow Taiwan companies to import solar cells and wind turbines from mainland China, slowing down the decrease in project capex and levelized costs brought by the mainland market’s massive scale. Local so-called Nimby movements, taking the forms of environmental protectionism and land transfer challenges, are significant barriers for project implementation. Taipower has modified the feed-in tariff rules at least twice before: in 2010 to shorten the commissioning deadline for solar auction winners, and then in 2012-13 to renegotiate tariffs with thermal IPPs. These changes provide concerns over whether Taipower will retrospectively lower the feed-in tariff rates for offshore wind and other technologies."}]}
