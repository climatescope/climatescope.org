energy policy","value":"Clean energy remains a low priority in Turkmenistan due to cheap and heavily subsidized natural gas, which accounts for nearly all of the country's electricity mix. Despite some overtures by the government to seriously consider renewables, such as working studies, a commitment to increase PV with neighboring countries and pilot programs, there has been no regulation or policy enacted to support these technologies."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"There is no significant installed renewables capacity in Turkmenistan and no clear strategy by the Ministry of Energy to grow the sector. Barring any clear direction set by the President's office, the forecasted growth of renewables is very limited. And, since the country has a closed off economy, private international finance is difficult to obtain."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Despite the price of electricity recently being doubled from $0.04/kWh, rates in Turkmenistan are among the lowest in the region. Heavily subsidized electricity has been a key strategic policy of the government and only recently has the Ministry of Energy attempted to bring the price closer to cost. Tariffs should continue to increase in the future but are still far away from wholesale rates."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Natural gas accounts for nearly 100% of the country's power mix, a significant portion of which is exported to neighboring countries. There are no clear regulations or tariffs to support other technologies and there is no competitive market for independent producers. Tukmenenergo, the state-owned utility, controls all aspects of the power market, including generation, transmission, distribution and exports. There are no formal plans to liberalize the market despite some movements to increase electricity tariffs.  Some large industrials self-generate some power but are prohibited from selling excess back to the grid."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand is expected to increase along with exports of electricity to neighboring countries. Domestic demand is also expected to increase slightly as the industrial sector grows. Despite nearly 100% electrification, this will put a strain on the grid, which is plagued by blackouts and instability.  The existing power fleet is a legacy of Soviet times but there are plans to modernize it. Investment in the sector could significantly increase the efficiency of the system."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Turkmenistan is largely a closed economy, not far removed from its Soviet predecessor. Foreign investors are subject to strict limitations, including local content rules, setting up joint ventures with domestic companies and negotiating ad hoc agreements per project in the absence of set regulations. Not surprisingly, bureaucracy is notoriously convoluted and very transactional. Investing in the country is high risk. The Central Bank typically guarantees contracts but it is not independent of the treasury, and the health of both these organizations is tied to the price of gas."}]}
