energy policy","value":"The lack of active substantial policy support programs is likely to stymie renewables deployment in Nicaragua. The exception is the series of tax incentives to ease the clean energy project development process. Import tax and VAT exemptions for machines, equipment, materials and inputs for investment and construction, including the sub-transmission lines required to transport electricity to the national grid, the Sistema Interconectado Nacional (SIN). The incentives, introduced in 2005, were initially to be in force for a period of 10 years and expire in May 2015. In December 2017, the national assembly approved the law reform in which extends the fiscal benefits until 2023."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Libya’s power sector remains closed to private investors, so the country does not yet have a policy of providing financial guarantees to private investors nor has it established a green fund for renewable energy projects. Clean energy investment is in its infancy, and mostly concentrated on solar and wind power. Libya has signed contracts with foreign companies to build power plants and turbines, but this is entirely on government initiative. Due to the ongoing conflict in the region, clean power projects have been subject to numerous delays or have been abandoned altogether, which has impeded growth in renewables investment."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Energy prices in Libya are highly-subsidized and are among the lowest in the region, leading to inefficiency in the allocation of resources. Residential prices are broken down into three tiers as follows: 20 dirham/kWh for consumption of 1-1,000kWh; 30 dirham/kWh for 1,001-1,400kWh and 50 dirham/kWh for more than 1,400kWh. Electricity prices in other sectors are charged a fixed tariff of 68 dirham/kWh for commercial users, and 31 dirham/kWh for light industry or 42 dirham/kWh for heavy industry. Libya needs to implement significant subsidy reform in its energy sector but so far the country has not set plans to tackle this issue."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Libya’s generation mix is dominated by fossil fuels, namely natural gas and fuel oil. Renewable energy has so far been limited to small-scale applications such as rural electrification, water pumping, communication networks, rooftop systems and solar heating in the residential sector. Renewable energy capacity additions have lagged behind due to the ongoing conflict in the country. The General Electricity Company of Libya (GECOL) is 100% state-owned and is responsible for all segments of the market. No independent generators participate in the market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The Libyan economy has suffered from more than two decades of sanctions and a violent conflict that has stifled economic development. Still, power demand has been fueled by largely subsidized electricity prices and a lack of energy efficiency regulations in buildings. Solar and wind power have great potential in Libya but their contribution to power generation is still negligible. GECOL has plans for a large power capacity expansion program in the next 15 years, although its development depends entirely on the availability of funds and details remain scarce."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"New tax legislation in Libya states that all renewable equipment and components are fully exempt from customs import duty, but within the country no tax privileges or priority are provided to clean energy projects. Given the negligible contribution of renewables to the generation mix, there is no risk of curtailment nor offtaker risk, since the market remains closed to private generators. Libya is engulfed in a complex conflict, so political risk, among others, is high.  Foreign sources of investment, whether from international organizations or the private sector, seem unlikely to tap into potential opportunities in the current setting."}]}
