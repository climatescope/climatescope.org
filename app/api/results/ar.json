energy policy","value":"Argentina has set an 8% target for renewable electricity consumption by 2018 and 20% by 2025 under Law 27.191. The law represents a landmark for clean energy in the country, as it created the Trust Fund for the Development of Renewable Energies (FODER) and provided tax incentives to boost investments in renewables – a VAT tax rebate and accelerated depreciation. Under Resolution 281-2017, Argentina also establishes that large consumers (>300kW) need to comply with the 8% target individually and allows companies to make bilateral corporate PPAs. Projects subscribed to the scheme receive priority of dispatch. The country has implemented a series of renewable power auctions, RenovAr, to spur the development of clean energy projects. As of November 2018, RenovAr tenders have contracted a total of 3.8GW of clean capacity. However, despite this growth, Argentina is unlikely to meet its target."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"A scarcity of capital, price-distorting subsidies, and political risk combined to make Argentina a relatively unappealing destination for clean energy investment in the first half of this decade. That began to change in December 2015 with the arrival of President Mauricio Macri. Since then, Macri’s government has sought to cut subsidies and liberalize energy markets to spur conventional and renewable project build underwritten with foreign capital. FODER, created under his administration, was backed by the World Bank, which provided guarantees of payments for the renewable tenders. The guarantees boosted confidence among foreign debt providers. Only then, Argentina started to see financing in the sector, accounting for $3.1 billion in the past two years. Despite recent progress, Argentina’s current macroeconomic crisis may push investors away and create difficulties for auction-winning projects that have yet to secure financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Since Macri took power, electricity prices have spiked, as customer subsidies have been cut. In 2016, industrial prices grew by 260%, while residential increased by 219% compared to the previous year. In 2017, commercial, industrial and residential prices rose by 71%, 183% and 173%, respectively. CAMMESA, the governmental market regulator, regulates tariffs and is also the offtaker for the RenovAR auctions. Auction bids have consistently dropped each round, averaging $59.6/MWh in the first, $54/MWh in the second, and $42.4/MWh in the last round."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Argentina’s power matrix remains largely reliant on thermal and large hydro assets. Currently, 51% of installed capacity is gas power plants, with hydro representing 30%. The country has a considerable amount of oil & diesel assets at 11% of the mix. Renewables sum to only 2.5%. Argentina added approximately 4GW of gas assets in the last year alone, when it also retired 1.7GW of oil & diesel plants. The total capacity of clean plants added was less than 60MW in 2017, although it is expected the country will commission 3.8GW in the short term, as a result of the three rounds of renewable tenders. Despite considerable effort, it is unlikely the country will meet its 8% renewables goal by year-end 2018. In December 2017, only 2% of its generation came from small hydro, wind, solar and biomass. Most of the clean generation is due to small hydro power plants."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Argentina’s clean energy investment is likely to be affected by the recent macroeconomic crisis, especially the financing of projects from RenovAr 2.0, which awarded contracts to 1.8GW of wind and solar assets. Additionally, the Ministry of Energy decreased the amount of capacity to be tendered considerably in 2018. RenovAr MiniRen 3.0 will tender around 400MW, contrasting with the 1GW initially expected and will focus on small projects limited to 10MW of capacity."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Despite Macri government initiatives to boost clean energy and cut emissions, Argentina has a long road ahead to achieve all its targets. Efforts to rebuild international investor confidence are a work in progress, as the country continues to navigate macroeconomic crises. The current crisis will likely hurt the ability of projects to obtain financing, especially for the most recent auction, RenovAr Round 2, and upcoming mini auction, RenovAr MiniRen 3.0. Constrained transmission and distribution networks stand to inhibit wind and solar build. While Argentina has taken important steps to foster its clean energy industry, important barriers remain."}]}
