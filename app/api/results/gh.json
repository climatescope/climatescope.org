energy policy","value":"The government has a clean energy target of 500MW. While this was originally to be commissioned by 2020, it is now unlikely that this will be built before 2030. This is because the government undertook a program in 2017 to review all PPAs signed following the energy crisis in 2016.  Because it considered that these were overpriced and did not offer value to Ghanaians, it cancelled some of the PPAs and delayed all those for renewable energy projects until 2025 or 2030."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment has stalled over the last couple of years as the government embarked on the PPA review, which delayed most renewables projects. The majority of investment in renewable energy in Ghana has come from foreign sources, with the largest solar project (20MW) being financed by Chinese investors. The African Development Bank is currently assessing opportunities to invest in renewables in Ghana and, while a number of domestic funds are looking to back renewables, they have yet to sign on the dotted line."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Ghana has some of the highest power prices in the region, due to an inefficient transmission system, with high losses, and a failure to effectively collect revenue. As a result, the power-price spike in 2016/17 became one of the main focuses of the 2016 election. As part of his campaign, President Nana Akufo-Addo promised to lower electricity tariffs to help industry. In March 2018, acting on the President’s promise, the government unveiled new electricity tariffs that were up to 30% lower than the previous rates. The reductions were also extended beyond just the industrial sector to residential and commercial customers as well. The new tariffs are not reflective of the cost of generation and transmission, and so are heavily subsidized."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The power market in Ghana has been through turbulent times in recent years. In 2016 it faced power shortages that led to the signing of high priced PPAs, which have now been delayed or cancelled. More recently, the main offtaker, the Electricity Company of Ghana (ECG), had to be rescued through a concession won by Meralco, the Philippine electricity company. The concession is aimed to turn around the poor finances of ECG and increase investment in the Ghanaian grid. Oil and gas provides the majority of Ghana's electricity supply, accounting for a combined 68% of generation in 2017. The remainder mostly comes from hydropower, so that low water levels pose a risk around the future availability of these plants. Renewable energy is largely confined to two utility-scale PV plants, with little prospect of new projects in the near future. There is an increasing number of (often solar) mini-grids being deployed in off-grid communities."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ghana has been growing, in part thanks to an increase in the percentage of the population with access to electricity. However, for the industrial sector, a significant challenge is the lack of access to a reliable electricity supply. The government believes that if the reliability of supply can be improved, industry will grow. This has become key to the restructuring of ECG, part of which requires the Meralco consortium to invest in improving the efficiency of the transmission network."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Offtaker risk remains the biggest barrier to renewables deployment in Ghana. ECG the main offtaker had to be rescued early in 2018 due to its poor finances, which meant that PPAs it had signed were not sufficient to secure financing for projects, without a put-call option agreement (PCOA), or government consent and support agreement (GCSA) also being put in place. The government then undertook a further PPA review process in 2018, which will delay any new build until 2020 at the earliest. Further to this, in August 2018 the President sacked the minister for energy (Boakye Agyarko) due to proposals for a renegotiation of a $510 million private power deal. In addition to impeding power policy development and the electricity market reform process, this is likely to exacerbate uncertainty around the Ghanaian government’s stance on renewables, at least in the short term."}]}
