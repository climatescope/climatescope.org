energy policy","value":"The government of Laos has billed the country as the 'battery of Asia', eager to capitalize on its abundant hydroelectric resources and small population to export energy to its larger, fast-growing neighbors. Accordingly, it has focused its attention on building large hydro power plants that, in many cases, send power directly across its borders to Thailand or Vietnam. The government is targeting a 30% share for non-hydro renewables in the power mix by 2025. EDL-Gen Solar Power Company was established in 2015 with the aim of building 100MW of solar by 2020. This will not be enough to achieve the 30% target. The government has not announced any further strategies yet on how it is planning to achieve the target."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The power market in Laos is currently oversupplied with carbon-free hydroelectricity, leaving little incentive for the government or local companies to invest in non-hydro clean energy technologies. The bulk of recent investment ' in large hydroelectric facilities and a single coal-fired plant ' has been financed by Thailand and Vietnam for their own consumption. Only one 10MW solar project has been built to date in Laos, by a local company (EDL-Gen) but with significant support from international partners. China, Thailand, Japan and Vietnam are dominant players in the market. There is little to no domestic concessional financing available, and few banks in the country have the capacity to finance power projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Laos are relatively low, due to its abundance of low-cost hydroelectricity. The government sets electricity tariffs and subsidizes industry, residential consumers, agriculture and small and medium enterprises with rates below the cost of service. Banks and hotels, on the other hand, have to pay significantly higher tariffs, which can make onsite solar competitive for a small segment despite the absence of net metering or other incentives. Rates have remained stable through 2017-2018. The government announced, at the beginning of 2019, that it will try to cut electricity prices for households and businesses."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"The domestic power market in Laos has a single-buyer structure, with électricité du Laos (EDL) the sole buyer and retailer as well as the grid operator. Power generation was partially liberalized in 2010, when EDL spun off its large hydro assets under EDL-Gen, in which it owns a stake of about 75%. Independent power producers are also active in the market. They have been responsible for roughly 90% of the capacity additions since 2015. Capacity additions picked up rapidly from 2013 onwards, due to external demands: Thailand's EGAT financed, contracted and now dispatches several new large hydro projects and a 2GW coal plant. External demands will keep on driving new capacity addition as Laos is planning to double its transmission capacity with neighbors Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia, Cambodia and Myanmar over the next few years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand has surged as Laos has extended its electric grid to the countryside, with peak load doubling between 2010-2018 and overall generation (much of which is exported) almost quadrupling over the same time frame. Laos aims to reach 98% household electrification by 2020. It is well on its way, according to official statistics, with 94% electrification in 2018, compared to only 15% in 1995. Concerns remain, however, on the quality of the power supply to rural areas, and many speculate that the true electrification rate remains around 70-80%. Off-grid systems are an option for the remaining households, but the remoteness of these homes means that income-generating opportunities ' and therefore, the ability to pay for solar home systems ' remain limited. Most solar home systems to date have effectively been financed through grants."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"A dam collapse in 2018 temporarily put under-construction hydro plants on hold while the government investigated the incident. Work resumed in September 2018. As a result, another 2GW of hydropower is expected to be commissioned in 2019 and no priority has been given to other renewables technologies such as solar. Meanwhile, offtaker risk remains a significant obstacle to new projects of all types: projects with EDL as offtaker are considered unbankable due to the utility's financial difficulties. Projects for the Thai market have been more successful because EGAT, Thailand's utility, is considered a credit-worthy offtaker. However, as EGAT's supply has slowly caught up with electricity demand, its interest in projects in Laos has levelled off. This means many new projects will likely have EDL or Vietnam's utility, EVN, as offtaker, which will make financing more difficult."}]}
