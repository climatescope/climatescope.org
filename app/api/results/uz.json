energy policy","value":"Uzbekistan has a small renewables target for 2030, which it is on track to meet. However, this is not yet supported by legislation that would offer stable renewable energy growth. The regulatory framework is being worked on with the help of development institutions and there is no framework for feed-in-tariffs or auctions at present. A few renewable energy projects are being planned and interest is supported by the notable potential for changes in policy. Projects at present are negotiated with government authorities on an ad hoc basis. The country has agreed to build its first nuclear power station, with Russia's Rosatom, which once completed, will offer stability to a weakened power network."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The growth rate in renewables investments in Uzbekistan is irregular, driven by announcements of projects such as that made by SkyPower, for a 1GW investment in solar power. Outside of the very few headline cases, investment is scant. The government seems to be targeting solar over wind, although this may be more dependent on the investors showing interest in the market. Finance for renewables is backed by international development institutions, such as the ADB, the IFC and the EBRD. Renewables are very much in the early days of development in Uzbekistan. Investment has mostly been directed to hydropower in the past, with the refurbishment of some hydro plants having been funded, although these assets are all state-owned."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices have increased in recent years, although they are still quite heavily subsidized. Central Asia countries all have similar prices, and connections between them have been restored after they lapsed following the collapse of the Soviet Union, allowing for some imports and exports. Uzbekistan's old generation assets are in need of an upgrade in order to be able to meet peak power demand ' which outstrips supply in the peak winter periods, leading to power outages. The ability to raise power prices while such a situation continues may be limited, as outages are already leading to local protests. Generation is largely fueled by locally-produced natural gas ' so improvement in the costs of power will be made through improved efficiencies in power plants."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Gas accounts for most generation, followed by large hydro. This is not about to change. In renewables, some wind and solar are in planning or discussion, but the targets are very limited. The country has reconnected with some of its neighbors after abandoning a regional network in 2009. This reconnection will allow for imports and exports or power and help to develop a regional market. Plans to export power to Afghanistan have provoked local protests in regions that face blackouts during the high-demand period of winter. Renewables do not get priority dispatch, and the frameworks for managing a larger amount of renewables in the power system are not in place. The state-controlled utility is the sole purchaser of renewable generation, with an implied state guarantee. The market is not unbundled, but is state controlled and vertically integrated. Plans to reform the system are advancing slowly with assistance from development institutions. There is no market for corporate PPAs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand growth has been largely flat since 2012, according to the Ministry of Economy. However, blackouts in some parts of the country during peak demand periods indicate that demand is not always met. The country's economic development has been boosted by oil and gas production for export. Other sectors have been languishing, and agriculture, another mainstay of the economy, has been battling issues including water scarcity. Much is made of the potential for renewables development in Uzbekistan, due to its good wind and solar resources. The country has embarked on the construction of its first nuclear power plant, with Russia's Rosatom, aiming to help stabilize the power system which, as in many former Soviet republics, is in dire need of investment."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There is no local manufacturing of renewable energy assets or equipment to speak of, and so there are no local content requirements. Projects are negotiated on an ad hoc basis so could benefit from tax or cost breaks, but there is no consistent framework for this yet. The major barrier to developing renewables in the country is the lack of a clear and transparent framework for developing projects. Political and currency risk are considerable, even though the country does have targets for renewable energy. The government is seeking to tender large-scale projects but this may not lead to consistent growth until there is more clarity on the regulation of the sector and its relationship with the state-owned end purchaser of renewable power."}]}
