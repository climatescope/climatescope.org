energy policy","value":"Aiming for a 21% share of renewable energy in power generation by 2020 and 26% by 2025, Armenia's target is very ambitious given the current share of 13%. While the country is likely to achieve its small hydro capacity targets, it is a long way off from meeting its onshore wind, geothermal and solar PV targets. Since 2007, Armenia offers a technology-specific feed-in tariff with a 15-year power purchase agreement to incentivize clean energy deployment. However, these tariffs are quite low, with the wind tariff recently halved, thereby stalling project discussions with developers. Renewable energy equipment is exempt from customs duties and the value-added-tax may be adjourned for up to three years following an official request. Commercial and residential self-generators can utilize their own electricity and feed excess power into the grid, selling at 50% of residential prices (or even 100% in the case of small hydro). This was limited to 150kW until 2018 and increased to 500kW in 2019."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in renewable energy has been gradually increasing over the last few years, especially for solar PV installations. In terms of utility-scale projects, Spain's Fotowatio won Armenia's first large-scale auction to develop the 55MW Masrik-1 solar PV plant in 2018, financially backed by the 'Scaling up Renewable Energy Program' (SREP) and the World Bank. Developers Acciona and Access Power are exploring the development of large-scale wind projects; discussions have ostensibly stalled, however, following the slashing of the wind feed-in tariff from $0.09/kWh to $0.05/kWh in 2019. Since 2016, Armenia's energy ministry also manages a Renewable Resources and Energy Efficiency Fund to provide concessional financing for small-scale clean energy and energy efficiency projects."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Armenia's retail electricity prices are higher than those of neighboring Azerbaijan and Georgia, but not drastically so. Power prices are not subsidized, but are low enough to be acceptable to most of the population. The country is reliant on imported gas for roughly under half of its generation. Energy security is a major driver of the shift to renewable energy. The cost of clean energy in Armenia is falling, and becoming favorable compared to gas. The Masrik-1 auction price of $41.90/MWh was lower than many in the government foresaw, and is expected to be used as a baseline tariff for other, smaller projects."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Armenia's installed capacity comprises just over half natural gas and one-third hydro, with the remainder being predominantly nuclear. Besides a few utility-scale solar PV and wind plants, some small-scale hydropower plants have been announced, with a near complete lack of geothermal projects in the pipeline. Renewables are being installed mostly to displace gas and provide more power for the summer peak. The power market is being liberalized in order to align with EU rules. The generation market is fully liberalized, with a range of owners and smaller players, while transmission is controlled by state-owned High Voltage Electric Networks (HVEN). For the moment, privately-owned Electric Networks of Armenia (ENA) is the sole buyer and supplier of power for retail and industrial consumers."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Armenia's peak demand has been falling, from a high of 1.5GWp in 2013. The country's economy has been relatively stable throughout the period, but there has been an increase in energy efficiency efforts and regulation. In a country where the main industry is construction, these regulations could have a marked effect on power demand. Armenia is 100% electrified, with little need for off-grid capacity. Resources for solar and wind are good, though transmission constraints and policy flip-flops have prevented much investment in wind. There are plans to modernize the hydropower fleet in order to extend the life of the plants."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"There are few barriers to clean energy investment in Armenia. The country has taken steps to build a domestic supply chain for PV equipment and services, with tax incentives and domestic funds in place to support such endeavors. The government has granted licenses for small systems ranging from 0.5'5MW to encourage local providers to develop expertise. The process for building and connecting renewable energy has been fairly straightforward, and the ministry has been offering supply agreements of at least 15 years. However, the new government which came to power in May 2018 has shown little ambition to create a more favorable investment environment for renewables, having lowered feed-in tariffs for all technologies in 2019 and given little indication on its energy strategy going forward."}]}
