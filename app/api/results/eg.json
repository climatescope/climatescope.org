energy policy","value":"Egypt hopes to reach 20% renewables in electricity generation by 2022 (although this target was pushed back two years later than initially planned). Renewables build is finally gathering momentum. Support programs have helped spur development: despite a less-than-successful first round, the feed-in tariff, which has now closed, secured some 1.5GW of PV capacity. The tenders for engineering, procurement & construction contracts have been responsible for most renewables deployment to date because they have principally been attached to cheap financing from international development banks. In contrast, the tender scheme for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts has faced delays and changing specifications, while the bilateral and net metering systems have seen little-to-no uptake, principally because of the low electricity tariffs. The most recent auction program replaces the feed-in tariff, and the first round began in 1H 2018 for a BOO contract to build 600MW of PV capacity. Consortia comprising one global renewables player plus a local player dominated the bidders."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment levels in Egypt fluctuate year on year, depending on individual deals. 2018 investment volumes fell 75% from 2017 to $875 million, due to the second round of the feed-in tariff program. This was after 2017 saw a surge that helped the country secure a record $3.4 billion. As is common for renewables deals in Egypt, most of the financing for the feed-in tariff projects came from concessional investors (in this case, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and World Bank's International Finance Corporation). Indeed, the majority of total clean energy investment came from foreign sources. Japan and Germany account for the largest shares, at 21% and 14% respectively, largely because they are home to development banks JICA and KfW. The feed-in tariff scheme required that a certain share of investment come from domestic sources."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs in Egypt may still be low by global standards but they have risen significantly in recent years, as the government has sought to cut subsidy costs. Industrial prices have increased the most ' by a compound annual growth rate of 30% for 2012-18 ' while residential and commercial tariffs have climbed 15-28% over the same period. The efforts to reduce fuel and electricity subsidies are a condition of the country's three-year, $12-billion loan program from the International Monetary Fund. The government has said that electricity subsidies will be phased out by the end of June 2022 (three years later than planned). However, it has a tough task to balance these economic reforms with the need to ensure social stability, with over a quarter of the population living below the poverty line."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Egypt's generating capacity mix remains decidedly fossil-fuel-focused, with more than a 90% share. This is principally because the government has sought to build out capacity quickly after the electricity shortages a few years ago. As part of this strategy, Siemens completed in 2H 2018 its 'Egypt megaproject' to build three combined-cycle gas turbine plants totaling 14.4GW. As a result, gas-fired generating capacity expanded by 200% over 2010-17 and is expected to continue as the government seeks to exploit its recently discovered domestic reserves. With regard to structure, at present, the state dominates the power market, with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Co. (EEHC) and its subsidiaries owning more than 90% of each segment. The 2015 electricity law envisaged a gradual market liberalization but progress has been limited so far."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Economic growth helped Egypt increase power demand by a compound annual growth rate of 3% over 2012-18. However, 2017 saw a more modest rise of less than 1%, as economic activity slowed down, in particular in industry, and inflation more than doubled. Economic reforms in 2018 saw modest stabilization and peak power demand grew 5% from 2017. In the longer term, Egypt is expected to see a significant increase in power demand over the next few decades fueled by economic growth. The government is intending to meet the expansion in electricity demand through a mix of fuels, with plans for further coal power tenders and an agreement with Russia's Rosatom to build four 1.2GW nuclear reactors."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The Ministry of Finance guarantees all financial obligations of the offtaker (the Egyptian Electric Transmission Co., EETC) under the PPA for projects over 20MW. The offtaker does not have a history of non-payment but it does have a history of delayed payments. In the longer term, there is a question mark over what happens when EETC is no longer a subsidiary of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Co. ' as is envisaged as part of the power market reform ' and therefore may not be covered by the sovereign guarantee. The local currency has hovered around 17.60 Egyptian pounds per dollar since the beginning of 2018 ' a far cry from its level before it was floated (at some 8-9 pounds). Overall, some administrative processes could be streamlined, the government needs to implement international standards, and there is a lack of awareness about renewables among consumers."}]}
