energy policy","value":"Egypt aims to reach 20% renewable electricity generation by 2022 (albeit two years later than originally planned). Yet the country has only seen modest renewables build to date. This has not been due to a lack of support programs: despite a less-than-successful first round, the feed-in tariff, which has now closed, secured some 1.5GW of PV capacity. The tenders for engineering, procurement & construction contracts have been responsible for most renewables deployment to date because they have principally been attached to cheap financing from international development banks. In contrast, the tender scheme for build-own-operate (BOO) contracts has faced delays and changing specifications, while the bilateral and net metering systems have seen little-to-no uptake, principally because of the low electricity tariffs. The most recent auction program replaces the feed-in tariff and the first round began in 1H 2018 for a BOO contract to build 600MW of PV capacity. Consortia comprising one global renewables player plus a local player dominated the bidders."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment levels in Egypt fluctuate year on year, depending on individual deals. 2017 was no exception when the second round of the feed-in tariff program helped the country secure a record $2.6 billion – up from around $430 million in 2016. As is common for renewables deals in Egypt, most of the financing for the feed-in tariff projects came from concessional investors (in this case, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and World Bank's International Finance Corporation). Indeed, the majority – or 88% over 2004-17 – of total clean energy investment came from foreign sources. Japan and Germany account for the largest shares, at 21% and 14% respectively, largely because they are home to development banks, JICA and KfW. The feed-in tariff scheme required that a certain share of investment came from domestic sources."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity tariffs in Egypt may still be low on global standards but they have risen significantly in recent years, as the government has sought to cut subsidy costs. Industrial prices have increased the most – by the compound annual growth rate of 48% over 2013-17 – while residential and commercial tariffs have climbed 22-24% over the same period. The efforts to reduce fuel and electricity subsidies are a condition of the country's three-year, $12-billion loan program from the International Monetary Fund. The government has said that electricity subsidies will be phased out by the end of June 2022 (three years later than planned). However, it has a tough task to balance these tough economic reforms with the need to ensure social stability, with over a quarter of the population living below the poverty line."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Egypt's generating capacity mix remains decidedly fossil-fuel-focused, with more than a 90% share. This is principally because the government has sought to build out capacity quickly after the electricity shortages a few years ago. As part of this strategy, Siemens completed in 2H 2018 its 'Egypt megaproject' to build three combined-cycle gas turbine plants totaling 14.4GW. As a result, gas-fired generating capacity has expanded by 200% over 2010-17 and is expected to continue as the government seeks to exploit its recently discovered domestic reserves. With regard to structure, at present, the state dominates the power market, with the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company (EEHC) and its subsidiaries owning more than 90% of each segment. The 2015 electricity law envisaged a gradual market liberalization but progress has been limited."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Economic growth helped Egypt increase power demand by a compound annual growth rate of 4% over 2010-16. However, 2017 saw a more modest rise of less than 1%, as economic activity slowed down, in particular in industry, and inflation more than doubled. In the longer term, Egypt is expected to see a significant increase in power demand over the next few decades fueled by economic growth. The government is intending to meet the expansion in electricity demand through a mix of fuels, with plans for further coal power tenders and an agreement with Russia's Rosatom to build four 1.2GW nuclear reactors."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The Ministry of Finance guarantees all financial obligations of the offtaker (the Egyptian Electric Transmission Company, EETC) under the PPA for projects over 20MW. The offtaker does not have a history of non-payment but it does have a history of delayed payments. In the longer term, there is a question mark over what happens when EETC is no longer a subsidiary of the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company – as is envisaged as part of the power market reform – and therefore may not be covered by the sovereign guarantee. The local currency has hovered around 17.6-17.9 pounds per dollar since 2Q 2017 – a far cry from its level before it was floated (at some 8-9 pounds). Overall, some administrative processes could be streamlined, the government needs to implement international standards and there is a lack of awareness about renewables among consumers."}]}
