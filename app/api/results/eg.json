Ministry of Finance backs utility-scale power purchase agreements signed with the Egyptian Electricity Transmission Company, which has a history of making payments in full.  Administrative barriers when dealing with government bodies have been cited as an issue in the past. That said, initial issues surrounding currency risk and arbitration have largely been resolved, leading to recent projects being completed relatively smoothly. In addition, developers benefit from reduced customs duties and VAT rates for renewables equipment. Developers must still bear some currency risk, however – only 70% of Egyptian pound-denominated tariffs are indexed to the U.S. dollar."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"As in most leading emerging renewables markets, investment in Egyptian renewables has varied considerably year-on-year. New investment peaked at $3.3 billion in 2017 as many of the projects making up the Benban solar park reached financial close, while wind attracted the bulk of capital flows in 2019. Egypt’s renewables sector is one of the largest to be almost completely dependent on foreign capital. Top lenders include German development bank KfW, Deutsche Bank, HSBC, as well as multilateral backers such as the World Bank, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Egypt’s renewable energy authority is the top project owner on a capacity basis. But taken together, independent power producers of the likes of Scatec Solar, Engie and Ib Vogt also account for a large share of installed renewables."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"The government has set its sights on clean power providing 42% of electricity generation by 2035, with the target broken down according by renewable technology type. Worryingly, the target-setting strategy document has not been published, while intermediate targets for 2022 are unlikely to be met. But after some trial and error, Egypt has implemented a number of competitive renewables tenders. These include the landmark 1.4GW Benban solar project, commissioned in late 2019. However, a healthy auction pipeline has shrunk due to an oversupply of generation capacity, and there is little visibility on tenders due over coming years. Efforts are being made to encourage rooftop PV through net metering, rules for which were reissued in April 2020."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Peak electricity demand has increased by almost 50% over 2010-19 to reach 31.4GW. The pandemic has slashed power consumption, but demand is expected to resume strong growth. Moreover, favorable wind and especially solar resources align with the government’s ambitions regarding renewables. Egypt has its sights on boosting gas extraction, but plummeting renewables costs will render future combined-cycle gas plant additions unlikely. And while the country enjoys an overabundance of generation capacity at the moment, much of Egypt’s power fleet is composed of old, highly inefficient diesel plants which will be replaced over coming years. For its part, a 6.6GW coal plant postponed in April 2020 is unlikely ever to be built."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Egypt’s power mix is dominated by the addition of 14.4GW of Siemens combined-cycle gas turbines, invested in after a power crisis in late 2014. Together, these additions have provided a substantial reserve margin. Despite recent additions, renewables made up only 1% of the power fleet in 2019, and the oversupply could crimp growth in the short term. What renewables have been commissioned are contracted on a take-or-pay basis, guaranteeing tariff payments regardless of demand. Despite the growing role of independent power producers, state utility and its subsidiaries own and operate some 80% of installed capacity. Moreover, private-to-private power deals can be signed, but a robust framework governing such contracts has yet to be finalized."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Retail power prices are being raised as part of the government’s economic reform program. An announced phaseout of electricity subsidies by 2022 has been delayed until 2025 – ostensibly as a result of the coronavirus pandemic. Similar efforts are being made to remove subsidies for cooking gas, diesel and gasoline. Average residential bills have been raised from 240 Egyptian pounds/MWh ($40/MWh) to 1,070 Egyptian pounds/MWh ($63/MWh) over 2012-19. At $0.084/kWh, the feed-in tariffs awarded through the Benban projects are high by international standards, although recent auctions tendering individual projects have reached lower prices. Egyptian PV was cheaper than any other source of new bulk generation in 2019."}]}
