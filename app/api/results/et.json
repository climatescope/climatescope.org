energy policy","value":"Ethiopia's 4.3GW generation fleet, of which nearly 90% comes from hydro, is among the cleanest and largest in Sub-Saharan Africa. The country has far greater ambitions though, setting a goal for 17.2GW of power capacity by 2020. Despite over 8GW of large hydro in the development pipeline, Ethiopia will fall far short of its target. The roll-out of several policies in the near term should still make clean energy investment attractive in the country, however. A public-private partnerships law will allow independent power producers to negotiate power purchase agreements directly with the state-owned utility, Ethiopia Electric Power. The country also expanded its Scaling Solar tender, initially for 250MW, to 750MW, indicating a desire to diversify the country's clean energy mix."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The majority of clean energy investment in Ethiopia has gone to hydro, which makes up nearly 90% of power generating capacity, though wind and geothermal have also received investment in recent years. This investment has also been inconsistent year-on-year, usually correlating with the development of a large project. A lack of foreign currency reserves, due to high expenditure on big infrastructure projects, means domestic commercial and development banks play a much smaller role in the growth of the country's clean energy industry compared with neighboring countries. International development banks are picking up the slack ' traditional players like the World Bank, the Danish Energy Agency and the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) all have boots on the ground and are actively involved in Ethiopia's clean energy market."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The heavy presence of cheap hydro gives Ethiopia among the lowest power prices in Sub-Saharan Africa. Lack of exposure to fuel prices also has ensured minimal variation in prices. However, a currency shortage and the subsequent rapid devaluation of the Ethiopian birr caused the Ethiopia Electric Utility (EEU), who manages the distribution grid, to increase retail prices by 50% to $0.03/kWh in 2018 to improve its profitability. EEU is expected to double retail prices again by 2022 to $0.06/kWh to combat these currency struggles, but Ethiopia will still have among the cheapest power on the continent. Upon commissioning of the 6GW Grand Renaissance Dam, the country plans to export cheap power to neighboring countries."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Ethiopia Electric Power (EEP) currently owns all generation and transmission in the country and Ethiopia Electric Utility (EEU) is responsible for distribution. The roll-out of a public-private partnerships law will allow independent power producers to negotiate PPAs directly with EEP. Along with plans to tender out renewable generation, such as the Scaling Solar Initiative, these policies will go a long way in diversifying Ethiopia's power mix. Nearly 90% of capacity in Ethiopia currently comes from hydro, and the country has suffered from load shedding due to drought. A diversified power mix will also be essential in ensuring reliability for the country's growing commercial and industrial sector ' 13 industrial parks are under development in Ethiopia, expected to grow power demand by 1.5-2GW."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Most private sector opportunity in Ethiopia's clean energy space exists within the on-grid sector. The Ministry of Water, Irrigation and Energy has plans for 100% energy access by 2025, with 65% of this target being met through on-grid electrification. This target steps up to 96% in 2030, meaning domestic players have prioritized on-grid developments. Ethiopia has ambitions to be a middle-income economy in 2025 however, and power demand is growing fast across the country (estimated at 30% annually), meaning mini grids and off grid products will still factor into meeting this demand. The country has a separate goal of distributing 3.6 million solar lanterns and 400,000 solar home systems by 2025, but this potential has largely gone untapped."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Financing in general is a big challenge in Ethiopia. The rapid devaluation of the Ethiopian birr has led to currency risk, and there is a general lack of a domestic and foreign commercial banking presence in Ethiopia. Most financing to date has come from traditional players in the development finance sector, like the World Bank. The currency risk also leads to uncertainty around the credibility of Ethiopia Electric Power as an offtaker. While off-grid solar products in Ethiopia are expected to be exempt from value-add taxes like the rest of East Africa, enforcement of this policy is spotty, and many importers have been dinged with additional charges. This enforcement will need to be improved to grow the country's off-grid market."}]}
