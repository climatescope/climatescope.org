energy policy","value":"Uganda has achieved its renewable energy generation target and is set to achieve its renewable capacity target by the end of 2019. The country currently generates more than 90% of its power from renewable sources, including large hydro and biomass. Uganda currently has more than 1,000MW of renewables connected to the grid and expects to have more than 1,700MW commissioned by the end of 2019. Uganda's highly-successful Global Energy Transfer feed-in tariff (GET FiT) program launched in 2014, becoming the first competitive auction program for renewables in East Africa."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Uganda continues to develop its abundant hydro resources, pushing the power sector further down a low-carbon trajectory. The country's outlook for procuring other renewables such as wind and solar is more mixed. Uganda organized a successful feed-in tariff program that led to development of the region's largest solar projects outside of South Africa. However, government decisions to contract several massive hydro projects have raised concerns about oversupply and dampened appetite for future wind and solar procurement."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Uganda has relatively high retail prices compared to neighboring countries. This is largely due to the combination of cost overruns and expensive take-or-pay contracts with renewable (mostly large-scale hydro) projects. Umeme, the country's transmission and distribution utility, guarantees shareholders a 20% return on investment, further boosting prices. Residential, industrial and commercial rates have all increased more than 50% in real terms since 2010."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Uganda began unbundling its power market at the turn of the century, splitting up the utility's generation, distribution and transmission arms. To date, more than ten different independent power producers (IPPs) have commissioned projects on the grid. They compete alongside the state developer, Uganda Electricity Generation Company Limited (UEGCL). The country's transmission remains under state monopoly, with the Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) being the sole operator of the system. Distribution is liberalized, with Uganda Electricity Distribution Company Limited (UEDCL) licensing eight different electricity distribution companies, pending approval from the Electricity Regulatory Authority (ERA). The Electricity Regulatory Authority oversees all three segments of the power sector."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"A supply glut and lagging transmission and distribution infrastructure are dampening activity in Uganda's power generation sector. The most promising on-grid investment opportunities today involve building wires to transmit power to where it is needed most. The rural electrification and distributed energy sector is also booming. Uganda has a thriving off-grid solar industry, with many companies using pay-as-you-go and mobile money applications to power explosive growth. Offtakers are generally secure in receiving payments for contracted power. The transmission system operator, Uganda Electricity Transmission Company Limited (UETCL) is the sole offtaker for all grid-connected power in the country. Grid-connected projects to date have signed 'deemed energy' (take-or-pay) contracts, and UETCL's commitments are understood to be backstopped by the Ministry of Finance."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Several recent large-scale power projects have been dogged by allegations of corruption and opaque procurement practices. As a result, many donor agencies have curbed investment or set more stringent compliance guidelines for unlocking further funding. Transmission construction delays have also caused problems for several generation assets, including the massive 600MW Karuma hydropower project. As a landlocked country, Uganda must import many power components overland from the port of Mombasa, Kenya, which raises costs and extends project timelines. And while many of these components are VAT-exempt, unclear guidance and enforcement prevents developers from benefiting from preferential tariff treatment as much as the government intended."}]}
