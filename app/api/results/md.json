has incorporated EU legislation into the national laws and has been quick in adopting targets for renewables and interconnection rules established by the EU. The difficulties lie in implementation, which is hard and slow because of a lack of funding and a largely state-controlled system that does not lend itself easily to modernization or change in general. The country continues to be extraordinarily dependent on electricity from non-market sources, which creates artificially low price competition for renewables technologies. The absence of a forward power market or scheduled power auctions leaves prospective developers with limited visibility on future prices."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"To date, renewables investment in Moldova has been limited to multilateral finance institutions. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has solicited expressions of interest from consultants to manage Moldova’s clean energy tender program. The World Bank is funding a competitive power market project with the objective of enhancing Moldova’s access to the European energy market, which has a higher proportion of clean power. Spanish natural gas and electric utility group Naturgy Energy, an early investor in Moldova’s energy distribution market, in 2019 sold its electricity and gas assets in the nation to Duet Private Equity for a total of 141 million euros ($159 million). The assets acquired by Duet, now doing business as RED Nord, together with Premier Energy serve 100% of Moldova’s retail electricity market."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Moldova in 2013 introduced National Energy Strategy targets that include the use of 20% renewables in the country's total final consumption and 10% renewables in electricity generation by 2020. While it appears that Moldova will fall short of its total final consumption target, it is on track to meet its goal for renewable electricity generation. Moldova's law on renewable energy, which took effect in March 2019, specifies the use of tenders to contract renewable energy. However, to date no auction schedule or details have been issued. Net metering is available for customers generating up to 100kW for their own consumption."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"It is legally possible to set up residential and commercial PV in Moldova, and the country’s feed-in tariff allows system owners to sell their surplus generation. Overall power demand is growing slowly, as Moldova remains predominantly agricultural and its economic system contends with the breakaway region of Transnistria, which receives economic support from Russia. The post-Soviet Moldovan energy system requires investment as the grid is outdated technologically and remains unconnected with Western Europe’s. Plans to synchronize the Moldovan grid with the European system are moving forward fitfully. Moldova’s electrification rate, which approaches 100%, obviates the typical case for minigrids, paygo power systems or other investments needed for energy access."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Until Moldova’s desired power auctions actually begin, the country will continue to obtain roughly three-quarters of its domestic power from the fossil-fueled Kuchurgan power plant. Power from Kuchurgan or imported from Ukraine constitutes more than 90% of Moldova’s supply. Electricity supplied by Ukraine’s DTEK is sourced from thermal plants that burn coal and could include some power from wind and solar sources. Renewables generated in Moldova itself contribute a negligible amount to the country’s power supply. While distribution has been privatized, the rest of the power market is state-controlled and prices are regulated. There are plans to reform the system, which has six licensed power producers that operate in part under regulated tariffs."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The fossil-fueled Kuchurgan power plant, controlled by Russia’s Inter-Rao and located in the breakaway region of Transnistria, has maintained its near-monopoly supply status in Moldova, selling at a lower price than power imported from Ukraine’s DTEK. As a result, wholesale power prices in 2019 averaged around 987 Moldovan leu (49 euros) per MWh. Industrial and commercial retail electricity rates in 2019 declined slightly to an average of about 1.86 leu (0.1 euro) per kWh, while residential customers paid an average of 2 leu per kWh. Time-based retail electricity tariffs are not offered in Moldova."}]}
