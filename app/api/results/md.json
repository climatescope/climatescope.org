energy policy","value":"Moldova's 2013 National Renewable Energy Action Plan targets an overall 17% share of renewables in 2020 final energy consumption, with 10% of electricity demand met by renewable energy sources. It has enacted a tender-for-renewables policy under which the first power auction was to occur by the end of 2019. The government has incorporated the European Union's third energy package and adopted legislation and regulations to meet the requirements of the Energy Community, a group of southeastern European nations seeking to join the European Union's energy market and grids. Renewables benefit from exemption from the value added tax (VAT) on import, purchase and installation in Moldova. Clean energy self-generation incentives are restricted to net metering in limited cases."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"To date, renewables investment has been limited to multilateral finance institutions. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has solicited expressions of interest from consultants to manage Moldova's clean energy tender program. EBRD also aims to launch a green energy finance facility (GEFF) in Moldova, which it describes as possessing a national energy sector 'characterized by heavy dependence on imports.' The World Bank is funding a competitive power market project with the objective of enhancing Moldova's access to the European energy market, which has a higher proportion of clean power. Spain's Gas Natural Fenosa is the largest foreign investor in the country's energy system, having bought in 2000 the power distribution company covering southern and central Moldova, which serves more than 800,000 customers. There is no demonstrated expertise in financing of renewables projects by local banks."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The fossil-fueled Kuchurgan power plant, controlled by Russia's Inter-Rao and located in the breakaway region of Transnistria, has maintained its near-monopoly supply status in Moldova, selling at a lower price than power imported from Ukraine's DTEK. Wholesale power prices in early 2019 averaged around 966 Moldovan leu (49 euros) per MWh, down from a peak of around 1,320 leu in 2015. This volatility is largely the result of annual and bi-annual negotiations with private suppliers. Industrial and commercial retail electricity rates in 2018 averaged 1.56 leu (0.08 euros) per kWh, while residential customers paid an average of 2 leu per kWh."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Moldova's transition to clean power auctions represents its first step into wholesale markets. Until those projects come on line, the country will continue to obtain roughly three-quarters of its domestic power from the Kuchurgan power plant. Power from Kuchurgan or imported from Ukraine constitutes more than 90% of Moldova's supply. Electricity supplied by Ukraine's DTEK is sourced from thermal plants that burn coal and could include some power from wind and solar sources. Renewables generated in Moldova itself contribute a negligible amount to the country's power supply. Distribution has been privatized in the south and part of the central region. An attempt to sell off the network in the north failed, and it remains in state hands. The rest of the power market is state-controlled and prices are regulated. There are plans to reform the system, which has six licensed power producers that operate in part under regulated tariffs."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"As was the case elsewhere in the former Soviet Union, Moldova's power demand dropped as a result of the industrial decline when the U.S.S.R. collapsed in 1991. Demand has recovered slowly, as the country remains predominantly agricultural and its economic system contends with the breakaway region of Transnistria, which receives economic support from Russia. The overall economy grew by 4% from 2017-2018, with services and construction outpacing agriculture. The post-Soviet Moldovan energy system requires investment as the grid is outdated and unconnected with Western Europe's. Plans to synchronize the Moldovan grid with the European system have been drawn up, in tandem with a similar plan in Ukraine, but the effort required is enormous, requiring both financial and political resources that heretofore have not been evident."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Moldova has incorporated EU legislation into the national laws, and has been quick in adopting targets for renewables and other benchmarks established by the EU. The difficulties lie in implementation, which is difficult and slow because of lack of funding and a largely state-controlled system that does not lend itself easily to modernization or change in general. The country's 15-year feed-in tariff for renewable generation must be negotiated with the state-owned offtaker. To date, that incentive has produced negligible results. Moldova planned to begin renewable tender/auctions in 2019 with the intention of drawing in international investors. The increased transparency those auctions may offer could make the market more appealing to developers."}]}
