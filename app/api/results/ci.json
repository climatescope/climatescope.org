energy policy","value":"Cote d'Ivoire has set an ambitious 42% renewable energy target by 2030, which is marred by the fact that only 16% is to be accounted for by renewables other than mid-to-large hydro. That said, no such clean energy capacity has been commissioned to date. Clean energy tenders have been held since 2013, but only the first of the winning projects is starting to near completion this year. Tax incentives have been implemented for solar, with a halving of VAT to 9% and import duties waived for panels, but enforcement at customs is nevertheless erratic. Neither is there any supportive policy in place for off-grid project development at anything above a solar kit-level. Mini-grids are not allowed due to the government's focus on electrification through building out transmission lines."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Recent clean energy investment has largely been limited to large hydro. The 275MW Soubré dam, which began generating power in 2017, was backed by an 85% commercial loan with the Export-Import Bank of China. The country's first commissioned PV project reached financial close in October 2018. Germany's KfW Group will provide 36.7 million euros ($40.7 million) for the 37.5MW solar PV Boundiali project, which should be completed by the end of 2019. Currently, local financial institutions do not finance renewables and clean energy investment is likely to remain reliant upon concessional finance given the sector's immaturity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"An abundance of hydropower and domestic gas resources have contributed to low retail prices in Cote d'Ivoire. The government attempted to raise tariffs in 2016, but backed down in the face of protests, going as far as to compensate the affected consumers for the temporary price hike. International lenders, such as the World Bank, have renewed pressure to increase rates to no avail. The disparity between production costs and tariffs means that the sector as a whole runs at a loss. Despite such issues, offtaker risk remains low and IPPs are usually paid on time under their take-or-pay contracts with the utility. CIE's finances are also relatively stable thanks to the stewardship of French management company Eranove. The process of restructuring the utility's debt was completed in early-2019"},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Cote d'Ivoire was one of the first African countries to liberalize power generation ' opening up the sector to independent power producers in 1994. Three companies that own and operate gas plants account for more than half of installed capacity, with state-owned hydro-electric dams making up most of the rest. Compagnie Ivoirienne d'Electricité (CIE), one of Africa's few utilities not owned by the state, retains a monopoly over electricity purchase, transmission and retail. However, things may change following the renewal of CIE's contract with the state in 2020. The government's focus is on thermal assets for the time being ' a coal plant is being built, the gas fleet is being upgraded and an LNG terminal is under construction. On the renewables side, some 190MW of PV will be commissioned by 2020 and a 46MW biogas project is due online in 2022."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Cote d'Ivoire aims to attain full electrification by 2025. The country has one of the region's most developed transmission grid coverage, but still has a long way to go with a national electrification rate of 65%. Although less than one-tenth of urban residents lack access to power, an increasing disparity persists between rural regions and population centers. Demand is growing fast with peak load increasing as much as 65% since 2010. The question of the role to be played by mini-grids in meeting the population's power needs is expected to be resolved at the time of CIE's contract renewal in 2020. Such a development is unlikely, as policymakers remain wary of off-grid electrification."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The government's preference for installing thermal and hydropower capacity over other renewables is the biggest obstacle facing the deployment of clean energy. In addition, the longstanding presence of several IPPs does not favor market entrants. Other barriers include arbitrary enforcement of customs exemptions, an official aversion to promoting off-grid solutions and the utility's single-buyer status. Such issues as high tax rates, red tape and a ponderous labor market are also cited by developers. Yet the market could change quickly with the commissioning of the first utility-scale PV projects starting in late-2019, and much-needed power market reform could well accompany the CIE's contract renewal the following year."}]}
