energy policy","value":"Madagascar has a handful of relatively unambitious clean energy policies in place. By 2030, the government aims for 85% renewable energy in total generation, to be achieved primarily through hydropower. However, progress toward this target is slow, with the current share of renewables in generation standing at 55% and few clean energy projects of scale in the pipeline. The most recent developments include commissioning of the country's first utility-scale solar project in mid-2018, in addition to a call for tenders in early-2018 for 25MW of solar with energy storage, supported by the World Bank's Scaling Solar program. Further policies include a reduction in corporate income tax for renewable energy investments ' equivalent to 50% of the country's total investment so far in clean energy."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Madagascar is so far limited, with the main source of finance coming from international development institutions. French developer Green Yellow developed the aforementioned 20MW PV plant, with support from the World Bank. In addition to development finance, domestic companies are joining forces with international partners in order to develop projects. For example, Switzerland-based meeco Group announced in mid-2019 plans to develop two 45-kilowatt solar installations in cooperation with Madagascan companies Groupe Filatex and Enelec."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Madagascar power prices are relatively high compared to the average electricity tariff in Sub-Saharan Africa. Residential prices are comparable to the region's average of $122/MWh, but commercial and industrial tariffs are 1.5 to 2-fold more expensive than the Sub-Saharan African average at $213.74/MWh and $257.33/MWh respectively. All tariff types have increased in the last decade, despite government support for social retail tariffs. The steady increase in diesel prices and correspondingly high costs associated with the country's dependence on fossil-fired generation continue to aggravate state utility Jirama's financial situation."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"More than three-quarters of Madagascar's installed capacity is powered by fossil fuels, with the remainder accounted for by small hydro and solar, at 2% of installed capacity. Renewable energy additions have stagnated in the past few years, compared with the growth rate of new thermal capacity. For more than a decade, the generation sector has been opened up to independent power producers and there is a clear intention to attract more private and international investment to the industry. Independent companies can also sell power through direct sales or within rural electrification concessions, although experience in this segment remains limited. The typical PPA guarantees a volume and number of run hours to the generator for up to 20 years."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"With electrification rates encompassing only one quarter of total inhabitants and less than one tenth of the rural population, Madagascar offers significant off-grid clean energy development opportunities, particularly given the country's ample solar resources. Power demand has increased consistently in the past decade, at an average growth rate of 3% in the last three years. The World Bank is currently in the process of refurbishing the country's transmission and distribution infrastructure, in addition to restructuring state utility Jirama."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Project developers face multiple challenges in Madagascar. Not only is access to finance generally limited, but administrative processes and land acquisition pose further barriers to clean energy deployment. Moreover, the insecure nature of the grid will cause stability issues for larger projects. International technical assistance has therefore recommended that most PV developers in Madagascar include a battery in their project (as in the 2018 Scaling Solar tender) and finance their connection to the grid. Finally, the state utility Jirama is the sole offtaker on the main grid and is under considerable financial stress, causing significant offtaker risk."}]}
