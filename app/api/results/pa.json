Panama also has a feed-in tariff program that pays a 5% price premium to renewable electricity generators and a net metering system that allows renewable energy self-generators to accumulate credits in kWh up to 25% of their production. \nIn February 2018, the Electric Transmission Company (ETESA) announced that, due to changes in the law, there will be no specific tenders for renewable energy. Instead, all kinds of generation will compete with each other. Furthermore, ETESA said that each technology will be evaluated based on its pollutants and their associated costs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Panama's clean energy sector attracted $1.6 billion of investment over 2010-2018.
