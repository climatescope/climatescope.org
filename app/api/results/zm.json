energy policy","value":"Zambia is a politically-stable country with a fairly light-handed regulatory framework for energy, although it has non-cost reflective retail tariffs. The country has ambitions to diversify its power mix and improve access to electricity, and its policies reflect this. In mid-2016, Zambia's Scaling Solar program awarded 81MW in its first round, yielding some of the lowest solar prices in sub-Saharan Africa. Both winning PV projects, the 34MW Ngonye and 56MW Bangweulu, begun commercial operations in 2019.  However, the next Scaling Solar auction round is on hold, pending the completion of a cost of service review of the state-owned utility, Zesco. Zambia also awarded 120MW of PV capacity under the first round of the GETFiT scheme, with a second round due in 2019-20 for 100MW of small hydro. Along with the planned dissemination of 500,000 solar home systems and installation of 350,000 solar water heaters, Zambia is taking positive steps toward increasing access to modern energy services and meeting the growing demand for electricity."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Investment in Zambia's clean energy sector has shown positive growth in recent years. Between 2017 and 2018, the first Scaling Solar auction round attracted some $91 million of new asset finance, and the latest GETFiT round is expected to attract around $100 million in additional financing for small-scale PV projects. The country has received both international concessional and commercial support, notably from the Export-Import Bank of China that provided $130 million of debt, although the availability of finance from local debt providers has been limited."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Zambia are historically stable and low, due to the fact that they are subsidized. Retail tariffs are below the cost of production, so Zesco faces significant financial pressure. The utility's overall debt is estimated at $1 billion and it has reportedly fallen into arrears on payments to IPPs, after the 2015-16 drought led to the signing of emergency PPAs. For instance, Zescos's debt to Electricidade de Mozambique (EDM) for importing power from a Karpowership stands at around $70 million. In 2017, average commercial electricity prices were increased as Zesco began implementing steps toward more cost-reflective tariffs, which was also necessitated by inflation of the Kwacha. The tariff increase was approved by the Energy Regulatory Board, but subsequent upward revisions of retail tariffs planned for 2018 were cancelled following direct intervention by the President, pending the local election cycle. For renewables, high solar irradiation and declining technology costs hold strong potential for the development of PV capacity, but wind energy potential in Zambia is relatively limited. Zambia's hydro generation potential is estimated at more than 6,000MW, more than double what it is today."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Zambia's power market is dominated by large hydro assets and Zesco, a vertically-integrated utility owned by the Zambian government. Zesco generates, transmits, distributes and supplies the majority of the country's electricity. However, the sector is increasingly diversifying away from large hydro and Zesco's monopoly over generation, with IPPs capturing the majority of market share in other generation technologies. The share of large hydro in installed capacity fell from 95% in 2000, to 92% in 2010, and 78% by 2018, as IPPs commissioned new PV and fossil fuel plants. There is a pipeline for new hydro projects including the 2,400MW Batoka Gorge Dam power project, and several existing large hydro facilities are also being upgraded by Zesco. A large and untapped potential remains for small-scale hydropower, especially for rural electrification, which may change pending the success of the second GETFiT round. Zambia is largely a power-exporting nation, except for in years of low rainfall and low hydro generation when it becomes a net importer."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Electricity demand has risen on robust GDP growth, due to the expansion of copper mining and agriculture. Peak demand grew from 1.5GW in 2010 to a record 2.2GW in 2018. Despite the drop in copper prices in 2016, Zambia's mining sector has seen copper production almost double following the commissioning of the country's first coal-fired power plant, Maamba, in July 2016. However, Zambia's hydro-dominated power sector has failed to meet growing demand during times of drought: the deficit of power output relative to demand reached around 1,000MW in 2015 and 526MW in 2016, and resulted in load shedding. This had a devastating effect on the Zambian economy, bringing annual GDP growth downwards from a mean 7%, between 2002 and 2014, to 2.92% in 2015, which was the lowest since 1998. In 2019, drought conditions have again caused power shortages, with a peak deficit reported at 273MW. However, the country has made significant steps to improving load management with scheduled 4-hour periods of outages per day and exemptions for critical consumers. The national electrification rate is 31% (67% in urban and 4% in rural areas). The government's plan of 66% national access (90% urban and 51% rural) will likely require mini-grids or off-grid solar, as low population density and affordability can limit the case for major grid extensions to all areas."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Zambia, along with most other sub-Saharan countries, has an import duty exemption on all renewable energy equipment and machinery for agriculture, aquaculture and mining. Although Zesco operates as a single-buyer monopoly, controlling almost all generation, transmission and distribution of electricity, the sector is increasingly open to IPP activity. All non-hydro generation plants in the country are privately owned. The presence of the IFC and World Bank were a significant lever for the Scaling Solar auctions, which de-risks projects through off-taker risk cover and help the country to attract investors and lenders and lower project tariffs. Power Africa has been working with African governments and private sector partners to remove barriers that impede sustainable energy development."}]}
