power sector continues to suffer from inefficiencies and financial mismanagement in each segment. Off-taker risk is particularly high for generators, and investment is urgently required in transmission and distribution assets. The new government accepted a $6 billion IMF bailout in early 2019, focused on recovering costs in the energy sector and state-owned enterprises. Uncertainty over measures to implement the plan laid out by the IMF may impact investment in the country. The government is eager to grow the local manufacturing industry, but domestic business units have struggled to compete with tax-free imports from China."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Pakistan peaked in 2015 and has been falling since. Some 300MW of new wind, solar and biomass was installed in 2019, down from 700MW in 2016. Wind has dominated Pakistan’s renewable energy market, while investment in utility-scale solar has been slow to follow. Rooftop PV installations have picked up pace as a means to avoid frequent power shutdowns and save on electricity costs. Overseas investors active in Pakistan's clean energy sector include Zonergy and Three Gorges from China and Zorlu Enerji from Turkey. Most projects rely on some form of concessional financing."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Pakistan has a renewable energy target of 60% by 2030, which is not legally binding. Wind, solar, biomass and small hydro will make up 30% of all energy while the other 30% will be met by large hydro. Large hydro already makes up some 27% of electricity generation while other renewables only make up 4.3%. The renewables target is becoming increasingly difficult to achieve as more coal and gas capacity is being added to the power mix as part of the China Pakistan Economic Corridor project. Pakistan offers upfront tariffs for wind and solar which are akin to feed-in tariffs,   and cost reflective, but have resulted in new build of only 1.5GW in the last five years. Offtaker risk, land identification and transmission bottlenecks are some challenges that stall projects."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"A spate of new power plants commissioned in the last few years means that the gap between demand and supply has narrowed, reducing the frequency and severity of blackouts. Planners are getting ready for an era of surplus electricity on the government-owned networks, with K-Electric following in the next few years. This puts brakes on the expansion of renewables, even though they present the most cost-competitive option to generate power. Despite this surplus, transmission and distribution losses of between 20-30% mean that the market will remain highly inefficient and indebted."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Closing the power supply gap is a policy priority. In the past three years, the government has attracted over 8.7GW of new coal and gas capacity under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor project, compared to 1.2GW of non-hydro renewables in the same timeframe. Growing public debt means that generators often are not paid due subsidies, and power distribution companies cannot claim their heavy transmission and distribution losses from consumers. Captive power plants are common among industrial users. The behind-the-meter solar market is significant, importing over $300 million in PV modules from China per year. Power plants currently receive a fixed cost-plus based tariff from the single buyer. Reforms to transition to a competitive wholesale spot market are underway and to be completed by 2026."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Artificially low power prices, high transmission and distribution losses and unpaid customer bills contribute to more than $10 billion of circular debt. In June 2019, the International Monetary Fund agreed to a 13th bailout for Pakistan, worth $6 billion, focused on reducing debt in the power sector. Subsidy cuts on fuel and power tariffs are on the agenda. Consumers have already suffered several tariff increases since 2017, following an unstable electricity tariff policy. The government cuts tariffs to provide relief to consumers, only to raise prices months later to recover debt. The levelized cost of electricity of wind and solar continue to drop in Pakistan due to the global decline in equipment costs."}]}
