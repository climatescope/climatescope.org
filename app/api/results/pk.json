energy policy","value":"Pakistan has seen a rapid expansion of renewable energy since 2015, with some projects built under the bilateral China-Pakistan-Economic-Corridor (CPEC) initiative, which is driving Chinese funding to infrastructure projects in Pakistan. The government led by Prime Minister Imran Khan seems to be committed to the CPEC and clean energy, with an ambitious new target of 30% generation from renewables by 2030, and a further 30% from large hydro. The previous government had already decided on moving to an auctions-based regime instead of relying on feed-in tariffs, but little action has been taken on this initiative to date."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The total installed capacity of solar, wind and biomass is set to cross 2,000MW by the end of 2019. Wind has dominated Pakistan's renewable energy market, while investment in utility-scale solar has been slow to follow. Rooftop PV installations have picked up pace as a means to avoid frequent power shutdowns and save on electricity costs. Overseas investors active in Pakistan's clean energy sector include Three Gorges from China and Zorlu Enerji from Turkey. Most projects rely on some form of concessional financing."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Artificially low power prices, transmission and distribution losses and unpaid customer bills contribute to more than $10 billion of circular debt. In June 2019, the International Monetary Fund agreed to a 13th bailout for Pakistan worth $6 billion, focused on reducing debt in the power sector. Subsidy cuts on fuel and power tariffs are on the agenda. Consumers have already suffered several tariff increases since 2017, following an unstable electricity tariff policy. The government cuts tariffs to provide relief to consumers, only to raise prices months later to recover debt."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Closing the power supply gap is a policy priority: in the past two years, the government has brought over 6.5GW of coal and gas capacity online under the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, and there is more to come, trumping renewables new build. Growing public debt means that generators often are not paid due subsidies, and power distribution companies cannot claim their heavy transmission and distribution losses from the consumer. Captive power plants are common among industrial users. The behind-the-meter solar market is significant, importing over $300 million in PV modules from China per year, with some installed in country, and some re-exported to Afghanistan."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"A spate of new power plants commissioned in the last few years means that the gap between demand and supply has narrowed, reducing the frequency and severity of blackouts. Planners are getting ready for an era of surplus electricity on the government-owned networks, with K-Electric following in the next few years. This puts brakes on the expansion of renewables, even though they present the most cost-competitive option to generate power. Despite this surplus, transmission and distribution losses of between 20-30% mean that the market will remain highly inefficient and indebted."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Pakistan's power sector continues to suffer from inefficiencies and financial mismanagement along each segment. Off-taker risk is particularly high for generators, and investment is urgently required in transmission and distribution assets. The new government campaigned on an anti-corruption agenda, but accepted a new $6 billion IMF bailout in early 2019, focused on recovering costs in the energy sector and state-owned enterprises. Uncertainty over measures to implement the plan laid out by the IMF may raise uncertainty over investment in the country. The government is eager to grow the local manufacturing industry, but domestic business units have struggled to compete with tax-free imports from China."}]}
