are restrictions on the use of agricultural land for renewables projects and on the production of bioethanol by foreign companies. There also are untested rules around the ownership of strategically important energy assets by foreign companies. Probably of greater concern are risk perceptions. Political fears subsided after national elections of early 2019 took place with relative transparency and uncontested results. The government’s approach to cutting the feed-in tariff though will shake the confidence of international players. The country still ranks poorly in international corruption assessments. Currency fluctuations have been a barrier to renewables deployment, though the feed-in tariff was linked to the euro to circumvent this issue. The administrative burden on foreign companies remains onerous."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Regulatory and legislative reforms spurred a boom in clean energy investments in Ukraine across 2018 and 2019, in which there was more than $5 billion in new investment. The biggest single investment so far has been by Norwegian wind developer NBT, with a $210 million loan for the first phase of the Syvash wind project. Local developers, led by Ukraine’s largest non-state utility, DTEK, have played a large role in the development of the sector, and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development has gone to lengths to present Ukraine as lower risk than previously perceived. Cuts to the feed-in tariff, which is backed by a sovereign guarantee, are likely to undermine this confidence, though smaller levels of investment may still be possible for projects that have secured feed-in tariffs, albeit at lower levels than expected."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Ukraine appears to be on track to reach its 2020 target of an 11% share of renewables in power generation. A generous feed-in tariff, tax incentives for the import of renewables-related equipment and a break on corporate tax for sales of electricity from renewable sources spurred a surge in build since 2017, though the market has been plagued by talks of retroactive cuts since September 2019. Ukraine’s Electricity Law, which came into full effect in July 2019, established an framework meant to support continued growth of renewables through a tender/auction program, but auctions have been delayed. The law also liberalizes the power market, clarifies the offtaker’s role and establishes a framework for standardized power purchase agreements. This boosted investor confidence, which had been undermined by political instability over the past decade and territorial conflict with Russia. More recently, subsidy cuts agreed to in July 2020 are likely to dilute that confidence."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Ukraine fell after the 2014 Russian annexation of Ukrainian Crimea, and ongoing militarization of eastern Ukraine has led to major economic volatility and a longer term slowdown. Demand has revived somewhat since 2016, as parts of the country have stabilized and returned to growth. The current generation fleet has been adequate to serve the national market, but Soviet-era nuclear assets must either be upgraded or replaced. The government’s drive to improve the energy efficiency of housing and public buildings is expected to limit increases in demand while renewables are developed. The aim is to reduce Ukraine’s dependence on Russian gas for its power and heating needs. Wind and solar resources are attractive, but the distribution and transmission system will require major investment to integrate growing renewables capacity."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Nuclear plants supplied more than half the electricity generated in Ukraine in 2019 – a proportion that has increased in recent years. Non-hydro renewables accounted for just over 3% of generation in 2019, and this share has continued to increase in 2020 as the renewables pipeline is built out. The upcoming power auctions appear likely to slow that growth rate, however, due to delays in implementation. The quota of capacity on offer could also limit new additions. The new power market structure will require further price liberalization to incentivize independent power producers to enter the market. Generation is only partially privatized, and DTEK is by far the largest single player."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Ukraine were regulated until the introduction of a wholesale market in 2019. New market rules have not brought full liberalization, however, as some state-owned power is price-capped to keep residential electricity tariffs low. The wholesale market is still heavily concentrated and dominated by fossil fuel plants owned by DTEK. To avoid excessive volatility, the wholesale market is operated with price caps. Both thermal and nuclear plants are in need of investment for renewal and life extension. It is unclear how this will be funded and how retail prices will change if and when price caps are lifted. Ukraine’s situation is further complicated by a shortfall in coal supplies from the east of the country, which has been destabilized by conflict with Russia. Coal imports have partially compensated for this, while some plants are retrofitting to run on gas instead."}]}
