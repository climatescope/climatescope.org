energy policy","value":"Tajikistan generates less than 2% of its power from renewable energy sources other than large hydro, and aims to increase this share to 20% by 2030. To support this goal, the government has called for the construction of small hydro and solar power plants and granted value-added tax and excise duty exemptions to renewable energy investors. Though these segments have yet to take off, its utilization of clean energy remains notable. Large hydro, for example, accounts for over 80% of Tajikistan's installed power capacity. The country's power system however fails to meet its electricity demand, particularly in winter months. Winter electricity shortages become severe due to high heating demand, a sharp reduction in imports of electricity and gas, and over-reliance on hydropower, which operates at a very low capacity in winter due to the freezing of rivers."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Tajikistan has not seen any serious investment in renewable energy. Although the government has called for the construction of small hydro and solar power plants, the country's installed capacity for small hydro remains at less than 120MW and no new solar plants have come online. Still, international development banks and public-private partnerships are making some progress. The Asian Development Bank approved a $10 million grant in 2013 to support green energy solutions in households and Pamir Energy, a public-private partnership company, is investing in small hydro projects in rural parts of the country."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Tajikistan, like most former Soviet Union countries, has low power prices due to government subsidies. Its electricity rates are however higher than in the neighboring Kyrgyz Republic, and have been increasing for the past several years. The government has raised rates in an effort to improve the financial health of its main energy company, Barqi Tojik, but not all tariffs have increased. The Tajik Aluminum Co., for example, still has access to a special, subsidized electricity rate, even though it accounts for almost 20% of the country's power consumption."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Barqi Tojik, a vertically integrated state-owned utility, dominates Tajikistan's power sector. Despite its strong market position, the utility is in poor financial health due to low subsidized tariffs, losses on transmission and distribution services and mediocre collection rates. The government has granted Pamir Energy the authority to generate power, provide transmission and distribution infrastructure and sell to retail consumers in one remote region, but Barqi Tojik acts as the utility for over 95% of the country's population. Industrial players consume most of Tajikistan's power."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Despite its near 100% electrification rate, Tajikistan suffers from power reliability issues due to its dependence on large hydropower plants, most of which are operating beyond their intended operating life. Still, these large hydro plants also provide the country with an oversupply of power in summer months, so Tajikistan is an active participant in the CASA 1000 project, a new transmission line that aims to better connect the country with the Kyrgyz Republic, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Tajikistan has experienced high GDP growth for the past six years, and peak power demand has increased moderately."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Tajikistan stands at the 126th position on the World Bank's global 'ease of doing business' 2019 rankings. Among all the criteria for assessing the rank, the country's worst performance is on the parameter of 'getting electricity'. There are numerous barriers to renewable energy development in Tajikistan, and market growth beyond the government's goals remains unlikely. While some polices have been introduced to support the renewables industry, the country does not have a feed-in tariff or auctions program. In addition to Tajikistan's isolation and lack of domestic renewables manufacturing capacity, there are other barriers such as the high cost of credit, and the lack of interest from foreign developers in entering the market."}]}
