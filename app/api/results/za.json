energy policy","value":"Once the benchmark of success, South Africa's renewables auction program is facing a protracted policy stalemate. In April 2018, Energy Minister Jeff Radebe signed power-purchase agreements for the 27 outstanding renewable energy projects from Rounds 3.5 to 4, after three years of delays. So far, 6.4GW of renewables capacity across 102 projects has won support through the scheme. Future plans will be driven by the updated Integrated Resource Plan (IRP), which outlines the country's planned generating capacity, and is currently sitting with the labor union, Nedlac. The March 2019 draft IRP closes the door to new nuclear power capacity until 2030, but also imposes limits for renewables technologies. In fossil fuels, the government has plans to procure more coal and gas capacity through dedicated IPP programs."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in South Africa has risen and fallen in line with the rounds of its auction program. Particularly high totals have occurred in years when winning projects reached financial close. In total, it attracted $20.5 billion between 2004 and 2018. The years 2014-17 averaged just $1.4 billion each, as the auction scheme was on standby, but 2018 saw more than $3.8 billion invested after the government finally signed PPAs for rounds 3.5 to 4. Two-thirds of the 2004-18 total was spent on solar projects, but this share compared to wind is skewed somewhat by capex-heavy solar thermal project investment. South Africa has the most diverse mix of investor types in a region typically reliant upon concessional finance for renewables projects. Of the $20.5 billion of asset finance since 2004, 45% has come from commercial banks and another 8% from private equity."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The winning tariffs have dropped significantly in each renewables auction: wind and PV fell 24% and 29% between Rounds 3 and 4, after adjusting the tariffs for factors such as inflation and merchant tail. Overall, the LCOE for onshore wind in South Africa ' at $62-89/MWh ' falls in the middle of our benchmark estimates in 1H 2019, as its relatively-low capex is counteracted by higher financing costs. It's a similar story for PV (without tracking), with an LCOE of $60-66/MWh. As is common in the region, South Africa has no wholesale electricity market and the energy regulator (Nersa) determines final retail prices. Eskom has repeatedly argued for substantial tariff increases to claw back its billions of expenses. Overall, tariffs climbed an average of 13.7% a year between 2004 and 2018."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Eskom, the state-owned utility, dominates the power sector. Independent generators have started to capture generation market share, mostly renewables, and municipalities are responsible for retail of electricity in some areas. (The customer still has no choice of supplier). The country regularly exports electricity to its neighbors through the Southern African Power Pool. South Africa saw some short-term load shedding (scheduled power cuts) in June 2018 and again in early 2019 ' but both were a far cry from the height of regular load shedding in 2014-15. Coal dominates South Africa's electricity mix, accounting for 73% of capacity in 2018. This share is likely to be maintained once the Medupi and Kusile coal plants (at 4.8GW each) come online together with the government's IPP program."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The main opportunity for off- or mini-grid projects in South Africa is in rural areas where electrification was at 66% in 2018, compared with 93% in urban areas. The Integrated National Electrification Plan includes initiatives to boost electricity access in rural areas ' aiming to fund an estimated 723,000 grid and 49,650 non-grid connections to households by 2019/20. Electricity consumption in South Africa has stagnated in recent years, declining on average 0.5% per year since 2006. The reduction has been mostly felt by heavy power users due to factors such as economic slowdown, volatility in commodity markets and rising electricity costs. This trend has been reflected in peak demand, which fell for a second consecutive year in 2018."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Investors remain wary of future policy stalemates and the offtaker ' Eskom ' which is now even more financially beleaguered and has yet to demonstrate its support for renewables. Eskom's financial woes continue amid weak power demand, non-payment by municipalities and governance issues. Even though the change of administration bodes well for renewables, there are vocal opponents to so-called \"expensive\" technologies. Tariffs in forthcoming renewables auction rounds could increase, as the government imposes tougher local content requirements and there is decreasing space on the grid with good resource potential. One barrier to rooftop PV is the lack of approved mandatory process to govern small-scale embedded generation connecting to the grid."}]}
