These investments were boosted by a feed-in premium that came into force in August 2013. A renewable energy feed-in premium is applicable to electricity generation from renewable resources.

Its average price jumped from $138.48/MWh in 2017 to $154.94/MWh in 2019. This was due to the end of the subsidy for consumers of up to 300kWh, which benefited 1.6 million ratepayers. Commercial prices increased from $163.27/MWh in 2017 to $169.23/MWh in 2018, while industrial prices were the least affected, rising 1% from $131.03/MWh in 2017 to $132.63/MWh in 2018."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Honduras has a total installed capacity of 2.6GW. In 2018, 28%, of total electricity produced came from oil and diesel plants. Large hydro represented 21% of generation, while renewables (biomass, small hydro, solar and wind) accounted for a combined 44% of power production. Solar capacity has increased by 31% since 2015, rising to over 500MW in 2018. Honduras is part of the Central American Electrical Interconnected System (SIEPAC) and is connected to El Salvador, Guatemala, Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua by transmission lines. Honduras is a net importer in the regional market."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The business environment for renewable energy in Honduras is high risk. Empresa Nacional de Energia Eléctrica (ENEE) has failed to pay the feed-in premium promised to solar plants commissioned by July 31, 2015. According to the ENEE, energy demand is growing and is expected to increase around 4% per year through 2030. Total solar and wind capacity grew by 36% between 2015 and 2018. The national electrification rate in 2018 stood at 81%."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Formal barriers to the development of renewables in Honduras are low. PPAs with renewable energy generators last for up to 20 years, but they cannot be renewed following expiration. Furthermore, ENEE is facing financial problems and has to renegotiate feed-in tariffs with domestic and foreign companies. In late 2018, the Honduran government announced an agreement to renegotiate the contracts. However, only domestic companies accepted the $0.03/kWh tariff cut, and ENEE is still facing financial issues.\n\nAnother issue that jeopardizes Honduras' electricity system is its fragile transmission network. On September 16, 2019, a blackout affected most countries on the Central American Electrical Interconnection System (SIEPAC) and Mexico. The cause was said to be heavy storms in Honduras. The fragile conditions of Honduras' and Nicaragua's transmission systems led to nationwide four-hour blackouts in both countries."}]}
