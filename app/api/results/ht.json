energy policy","value":"Improving access to energy has a central role in Haiti's president Jovenel Moïse's program. Moïse has abolished import duties on wind and solar generation products as well as solar appliances. The government has adopted the Scaling-up Renewable Energy in Haiti plan (SREP), with the advice of the Climate Investment Fund, and is preparing its first renewable energy law. \nIn terms of utility-scale power generation, grants and projects have focused on restructuring Haiti's national power company Electricité d'Haiti (EDH). On a smaller scale, microgrid projects are appearing across the island. On September 13, 2019, the United Nations Development Program (UNDP) launched a tender for the construction of three microgrids in Capotille, Valliéres and Mont-Organisé cities, as part of its Rural Electrification and Women Empowerment project.\nOn January 18, 2018, Haiti announced it is opening its generation, transmission and distribution sector for private participation in eight regions of the country by awarding concessions. As of the end of September 2019, the government had opened pre-qualification process for companies interested in providing power services in Miragoâne, Les Cayes and Caracol."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The country does not have specific legislation mandating microgrids, which slows down project developments and keeps risks high. Regardless, microgrids are appearing on the island. One, financed by the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), the United Nations Environment Program and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), links the towns of Côteaux , Port-à-Piment and Roche-à-Bateaux and is managed by a newly created electrical cooperative. Another in Feyo Bien, is supported by IDB. Both microgrids are powered by hybrid PV-diesel generators. Sigora Solar has also developed a diesel generator powered microgrid in Mole Saint Nicolas, to which it will add solar generation shortly. In 2019, the government of Haiti and the World Bank established a new financing instrument to incentivize private companies to develop clean off-grid energy projects in the country. With $17 million in funding, it aims to provide electricity to 200,000 households in the next 10 years."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Electricity prices in Haiti have remained flat since 2009. The residential tariff was the lowest, presenting an average of $112.03/MWh. The commercial and industrial electricity prices in 2018 were of $194.56/MWh and $198.25/MWh, respectively."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Haiti has around 284MW of installed generating capacity, with the bulk (80%) derived from fossil fuels. The remaining 20% comes from the P'ligre hydro plant, which is undergoing restoration, and other small hydro plants. EDH owns 44% of generation capacity in Haiti and is responsible for transmission on the 1,500 km of distribution lines on the island. Today, given infrastructure limitations, EDH is able to power Haiti's capital Port-au-Prince and a few cities nearby, but only intermittently. Meanwhile, the use of diesel generators, kerosene lamps and other forms of off-grid technologies is commonplace. EDH has received grants from the World Bank, the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB) and other international organizations to help the company improve its infrastructure."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Haiti has limited energy-related policies. The 2017-2018 Finance Act abolished all import duty taxes on PV generation equipment, wind generation equipment, and solar powered off-grid home appliances such as refrigerators, lamps and chargers. Only one-quarter of the population has access to on-grid electricity. The national grid shortfalls have created opportunities for distributed clean energy generation solutions and the implementation of microgrids. With the help of a grant from USAID, EarthSpark was responsible for developing Haiti's first microgrid, which started operation in the south of the country in 2015, providing solar power to around 450 households in the city of Les Anglais. The system relies on batteries to ensure reliability and smart meters for system stability and to facilitate pre-pay capability for its customers."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Haiti has faced many tragedies, such as earthquakes and hurricanes, which disabled most of its already weak electricity system. As an example, Haiti's first microgrid was partially destroyed in hurricane Matthew in late 2016, in which 20% of PV panels and all the cabling and poles were destroyed. \nAlong with this, Electricité d'Haiti is seen as poorly managed and corrupt, which adds to the challenges of doing business in the country."}]}
