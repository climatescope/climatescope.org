energy policy","value":"South Sudan does not offer any specific clean energy incentives, nor has it submitted a Nationally Determined Contribution in the framework of the Paris Agreement. The country lacks a clear energy policy altogether, with the only relevant previous piece of legislation being the 2011 'South Sudan Strategic Development Plan'. This sets out electrification targets and was in force until 2016, but a new official plan has yet to succeed it. The country's ongoing fragile security situation and unrest has diverted governmental focus away from clean energy deployment."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The growth rate of clean energy investments has been non-existent in recent years, with the majority of money invested directed at electrification projects by international aid organizations and foreign governments. Only 1% of the national population currently has access to electricity. The lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure further impedes any growth in clean energy investment. In contrast to the minimal installed capacity to date, there is a pipeline of large-scale energy infrastructure projects, most notably 2.1GW of large hydro. Many of these projects, however, are still lacking financiers."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"The South Sudanese government subsidizes power prices for the few customers with access to the grid in the capital and charges one uniform tariff. There is very little purchasing power in the population, but the main issue is not the lack of demand, but rather a lack of installed capacity. Moreover, the national grid is often not operational. A handful of regional capitals use heavy fuel oil-powered mini-grids, run either by the state utility or by local cooperatives. In contrast to those run by the state-owned utility, the grids run by the local cooperatives charge cost-reflective tariffs, thereby curbing customer numbers somewhat."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Fossil fuels dominate on-grid energy generation, with power plants consisting of a mix of oil or diesel-fueled facilities, with the exception of one small hydro facility in the capital, Juba. The majority of the population, 99%, is off-grid and relies on diesel generators for power. In terms of renewable energy, 15MW of distributed off-grid solar PV is progressively coming online, developed by Depo Energy. Furthermore, Scatec Solar will develop a 0.7MW hybrid PV project with 1.6MWh of storage in the near future, in addition to the previously-announced 2.25MW of hybrid solar plants. To support power market development, there are plans to create new transmission lines to Ethiopia, Sudan and Uganda."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in the country is growing and expected to increase 7 to 8% per year, according to government officials. This is due to the combination of population growth, very low electrification rates and little installed capacity to date. Taking into account the abundant solar resources, the case for off-grid solar development is correspondingly strong. On-grid growth is, however, limited by a lack of transmission and distribution infrastructure. In addition to the fragile economic and security situation in South Sudan, this will continue to make it hard to attract utility-scale clean energy developers."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"The major obstacle to clean energy development and foreign investment in South Sudan is the ongoing fragile security situation. Moreover, the lack of an adequate transmission and distribution grid poses a serious barrier to both clean energy development and wider electrification. In addition to the security and political risks, there is significant currency risk due to the instable South Sudanese Pound. With little policy or financial means in place to support the deployment of clean energy, adoption rates will remain low."}]}
