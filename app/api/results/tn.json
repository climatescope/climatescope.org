energy policy","value":"Tunisia aims to move toward a cleaner power matrix and jump from 3% of renewables generation in 2016 to 12% in 2020, rising to 30% by 2030. Two separate auction regimes (authorization for smaller projects and concession for larger projects) are the main instruments to achieve the objectives. Under the authorization regime, the government contracted 64MW of PV capacity in 2017 and 70MW in 2018, whilst a further 70MW is under tender. Under the concession regime, Tunisia announced in 2018 that it will contract another 500MW of wind plants, and contracted 500MW of PV in 2019. Project deadlines vary between 1H 2021 and end-2022 and the winners will secure a 20-year PPA with the state-owned utility STEG. In addition, retail electricity consumers in Tunisia that have renewable energy facilities can connect and deliver surplus generation to the grid, in return for payment from STEG."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Tunisia has received little investment in utility-scale clean energy so far, but that is poised to change as over 1GW of auction-winning projects are expected to be commissioned by end-2022. International development banks have been the main debt providers for Tunisia's clean energy plants. The country's Fond de Transition Energetique (FTE) will invest 2.13 billion Tunisian dinars ($730 million) in energy transition projects over the next decade. The budget has grown significantly, from 177 million Tunisian dinars between 2006 and 2015."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Due to the high level of subsidies, Tunisia's average residential electricity prices were among the 10 lowest in Africa at $52.50/MWh in 2017. Industrial and commercial prices ' at $76/MWh and $87/MWh, respectively ' are significantly higher than the residential tariff but still more than 50% below the regional average. In 2019, Tunisia signed a tariff of $24.40/MWh for 200MW of PV ' a record low for Africa."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Over 94% of Tunisia's 5.5GW of installed capacity and more than 95% of the power produced in 2018 came from gas-fired plants. As of end-2018, only 240MW of wind plants, 55MW of PV, and 62MW of small hydro were commissioned. However, the power mix is due to become more diversified over the next few years as auctions are due to increase the clean energy capacity. The state-owned utility Tunisia Company of Electricity and Gas (STEG) controls over 80% of power generation and has a monopoly over transmission and distribution of electricity and natural gas. IPPs are allowed in the market under the concession and authorization programs and can rely on a 20-year standardized PPA with STEG. According to law 2015-12 that regulates renewable energy generation, STEG is mandated to buy all power produced by clean energy plants."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The country is slowly recovering from an economic crisis. Growth in GDP reached 2.5% in 2018, up from 2% in 2017, and only 1.1% in 2016. The economy is forecasted to continue its growth trajectory in 2019. Tunisia's peak power demand is recovering, after a 6% drop from 2015 to 2016, and recorded a spike of 18% year-on-year to 4,025MW in 2017. This represented the greatest increase since at least 2011. It is one of few countries in Africa with nearly 100% electrification rates."},{"id":"barriers","name":"Barriers","value":"Uncertainties around political instability and relatively recent law (2015) that allowed IPPs in the market are the main barriers for international investors. This indicates that support from development organizations in the form of concessional finance might be required to change the market risk perception. Tunisia has a 0% import tax for wind and solar products from the EU and 30% for products from outside of the EU. The country also imposes a 19% VAT on wind turbines, towers, blades and PV panels, and 7% for inverters."}]}
