##<b>SRI LANKA’S ENERGY FUTURE, WHAT NEXT?</b> 

Sri Lanka’s power sector has an increasingly urgent to do list. Firstly, it must increase generation capacity to supply the rapid electricity demand growth, then, modernise aging grid infrastructure to improve the reliability of supply and avoid yet more nationwide black outs. Meanwhile, it must keep tariffs as low and affordable as possible, especially for the rural sector, which they have spent the last decade expanding the grid to connect.  Finally, the government also wants the state-run utility Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) to increase renewable generation (including large hydro) from 58% today to 100% of total generation by 2030. 

These challenges are tough. The country needs a competitive, dynamic power market that is efficient, modern and de-regulated. Instead they have the CEB, a monopoly business that resists renewables for fear of being hit with grid-balancing issues and higher costs, and whose powerful worker unions pressurise the board to fight the idea of offering large-scale generation projects to the private sector, citing national energy security and their rationale. 

This predicament has led to a strained relationship between the government public utilities commission, which signs off on future energy plans, and the CEB, which writes them. Currently, the CEB long-term generation plan looks to coal to provide cheap and steady base-load generation, with pumped and conventional hydro as dispatchable power sources that will help deal with the intermittency of wind and solar generation.  This coal-heavy plan has been unceremoniously rejected by the government and the CEB was sent back to the drawing board. 

Although not published at the time of writing, the new long-term generation plan is likely to be a compromise between the government’s demands and the current CEB blueprint. It is unlikely to aim for 100% renewable generation in 2030 but it is very likely to incorporate a lot more renewables. 

The planned 500MW Sampur coal plant is likely to be scrapped in favour of cleaner gas-fired generation, which due to its more flexible generation, will complement the intermittent sources of generation like wind, solar and small-hydro projects that are currently in the pipeline. There are also even plans for a new 10MW ocean wave power plant in Matara, although due to the high costs associated with this technology, this is likely to be more of a pilot project rather than a long-term answer to Sri Lanka’s energy needs.
