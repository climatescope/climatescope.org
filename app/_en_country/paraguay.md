With most of its electricity demand supplied by three large hydro plants totalling 8.8GW, Paraguay has had little incentive to develop a policy framework for other renewable energy sources. In fact, the country is a net exporter of electricity in South America. The only clean energy policy incentive in Paraguay is a biofuel blending mandate for gasoline and diesel.
Paraguay's electricity market is overseen by the Department of Mines and Energy, which is under the Ministry of Public Works and Communications (Ministerio de Obras Públicas y Comunicaciones) and controlled by state-owned vertically integrated utility Administración Nacional de Electricidad (ANDE). ANDE allows the participation of independent power producers (IPPs) according to Law 3009. However, as of 2014, there were no independent power producers registered in the country.
Paraguay exports power from its large hydro plants to Brazil and Argentina. Besides large hydro, Paraguay has a small group of generators totaling 200MW that use diesel for fuel. In 2014, the country generated a total of 55TWh, more than other South American countries like Peru which generated 45TWh in the same year and has a population four times the size of Paraguay’s (6.8m people). 
The abundant availability of low-cost electricity has a direct impact on retail power prices, which are significantly low – consumers pay on average $0.07/kWh to purchase electricity from ANDE. 
Paraguay mandates that all diesel sold commercially in the country must contain 5% biodiesel and gasoline must contain 18% to 24% of ethanol, depending on octane requirements. In June of 2015, the Paraguayan Congress approved a law to support the consumption of biofuels in the country, requesting on-site pumps for ethanol.
