Karnataka is perhaps best known for Bangalore, 'India’s Silicon Valley', where much of the country's information technology and software services industries resides. A number of companies in these sectors are today contemplating procuring dedicated renewable energy, particularly solar, to power their offices and data centers. 
Of Karnataka's 14GW of power-generating capacity, 4.8GW is coal and 3.4GW is large hydro.  Renewables account for 4.7GW, or one-third of the total, and wind represents half of that.  Still, some of the state's best wind resources remain unexploited in forested areas. It is estimated that projects in some of the best sites could achieve capacity utilization factors of 40% – far above India's national average for wind of just 23%. Karnataka's regulators appear comfortable with wind's rising share of generation because of the additional significant presence of large hydro capacity to stabilize the grid.
Karnataka had just 74MW solar installed at year-end 2014 but that is poised to grow considerably in coming years. The state has set a target of 2GW solar by 2022 and conducted a 500MW tender in 2014 after three smaller tenders in 2012 and 2013. 
Finally, Karnataka has considerable biomass capacity (1.3GW) online operating at a higher capacity factor compared to many other states.
