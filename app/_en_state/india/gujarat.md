Gujarat is highly industrialized, progressive, has excess power generating capacity, and can claim a 100% electrification rate among its citizens. The state is one of the few in India to feature private distribution utilities – the only ones rated ‘A+’ by the Ministry of Power in 2013.
Of Gujarat's total 30GW of capacity, half is represented by coal. Gujarat also has 7.8GW of gas – more than any other state and over half India’s total capacity. Renewables at 4.4GW represent 15% with wind accounting for most at 3.5GW. Gujarat now faces challenges accommodating an even a larger share of wind and trying to encourage forecasting for better planning and management.
The state has 902MW of solar installed. That is more than any other state as of year-end 2014 but Rajasthan is well on track to surpass it in 2015. Most of the solar was installed in 2012 as the state offered a very attractive feed-in tariff under a policy established in 2009. The state has since stopped permitting any new utility-scale solar projects on concerns of the utility overpaying generators. However, projects permitted under other programs such as the National Solar Mission can still be developed and with a new national 100GW solar goal announced, Gujarat is now contemplating a new solar policy in 2015.
