has few formal barriers to foreign investment and development. There is little domestic expertise in wind and solar, so most developers partner with a foreign business for equipment supply and construction. The political risk to new projects is low, as each one is considered individually as a proposal from the developer. New projects are virtually guaranteed a grid connection, though the operator can negotiate with developers on the location, to avoid grid constraints. Generators receive 10-year PPAs for all of their generation in the winter months. During the summer they may export their power to other countries through Georgia’s grid interconnections."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Financing is well-established and widely available for hydro projects, in which the country has domestic expertise. Wind and solar projects use both domestic and international concessional financing from the Georgian Energy Development Fund (GEDF) and USAID. The potential for new wind and solar development is bringing in European players. The wind and solar plants in operation have been majority-financed by the GEDF as demonstration projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Renewable energy installations in Georgia are driven by winter supply constraints and energy diversification concerns rather than the need to reduce carbon emissions. The draft Renewables Law sets the national target for renewable energy at 35% of final consumption by 2030; however, this is not in force yet. Most of the country’s electricity is produced from hydro and natural gas. There are plans for 600MW of wind projects, but these are in the approval stages. The government introduced a residential net-metering program for small-scale solar, but uptake has been limited. Most policy activity in the power sector is market liberalization to align with European Union requirements. The process is under the control of the Georgian National Energy and Water Supply Regulatory Commission (GNERC), the independent energy regulator."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand in Georgia rose by 30% between 2010 and 2019 but has started to level off. The majority of the growth comes from rural areas in the north of the country, where service is complicated by the presence of Russia-occupied territories. There are plans to upgrade the grid and add new high-voltage lines in order to accommodate new renewable energy. Aging hydropower plants are being refurbished to extend their lifetimes. The country is completely electrified, and there is little interest in off-grid developments."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Georgia’s power market is unbundled and open for privatization in all segments. There are 21 qualified generators in total. The main generators are the state, which owns the 1,300MW Enguri Hydro Plant, and the Czech private company Energo-Pro Georgia. In 2019, Enguri was responsible for 28.5% of generation. The vast majority of power is transacted through contracts, but a wholesale spot market has been growing slowly. In 2019, 10,367GWh was sold through direct contracts while 2,879 was transacted on the spot market. There is little market for corporate PPAs, though rising commercial and industrial power prices could increase demand."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Georgia’s electricity prices are fairly low thanks to legacy hydro assets. Customers with very low demand qualify for a below-market rate originally developed for disadvantaged consumers, but the subsidized tariff does not require means-testing and has been widely applied.\nMost of Georgia’s power is supplied by small and large hydro plants. In 2019, Georgia had a total installed capacity of 4,232MW and hydro plants accounted for 78% of the total (2,783MW of large hydro and 502MW of small hydro), followed by natural gas (913MW) and wind (21MW). Electricity generation in 2019 was 11,857GWh, of which hydro represented 75% of the total. \nGeorgia has significant grid interconnections with Armenia, Turkey and Russia, which it uses to balance its supply. The country has ambitions to become an energy exporter. However, hydro capacity additions are slowing due to public opposition to new large-scale developments. Wind is popular, and output could increase significantly if the government approves the project pipeline."}]}
