proved to be a tipping point for Colombia in terms of new pro-renewables policies and market changes, with growing interest from domestic and foreign developers catalyzed by the country’s first successful auction. However, clear barriers to renewable project development remain. Wind projects in particular face significant delays to commissioning as essential transmission infrastructure in the promising La Guajira region is held up. Home to many indigenous communities, La Guajira is an isolated and undeveloped peninsula located on Colombia’s northern, Caribbean coast. The region has excellent wind resources, but is poorly interconnected with the main Sistema Interconectado Nacional (SIN) grid. All of the wind capacity awarded in the auction is located there, which represents over 75% of total capacity awarded in the auction."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Most investment directed to non-hydro renewable energy in Colombia to date has come from international development banks. From 2011 to 2019, Colombia attracted $1.3 billion in investment, with a substantial increase in non-hydro investments seen in 2018, in anticipation of the country’s first auction and other positive policy developments. Solar accounted for the entirety of this investment, attracting $200 million. Investment is expected to regain highs in the coming years as auction projects progress."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Colombia’s historically weak policy support for non-hydroelectric sources of renewable energy has resulted in limited wind and solar development. However, 2019 saw the country hold its first successful long-term power auction, in which it awarded contracts to 1.3GW of wind and solar projects.  In the same year, Colombia also introduced a mandate for electricity distributors supplying regulated markets to procure 10% of their power from clean energy sources from 2022 onwards."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The government introduced tax incentives for investment in renewables in 2014, providing for accelerated depreciation of up to 20% per year for renewable energy investments; 50% income tax deduction on the value of investments up to 50% of taxable income for up to five years; VAT exemption for renewable energy equipment and services; and import duty exemption for renewable energy equipment. Policies introduced in 2019 have added momentum to the renewables market. Colombia’s first successful renewable auction awarded long term PPAs, paid in local currency, to 1.3GW of wind and solar projects. The presence of large global companies in the auction underlined the attractiveness of Colombia as an emerging clean energy market. With the exception of domestic player Celsia, all winners were large, global firms aiming to secure early market entry."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Of Colombia’s total installed capacity of 17.6GW at year-end 2019, large hydro represented 62% and provided 71% of the 70TWh of total electricity generated that year, followed by natural gas and coal at 10% of generation each. Other renewables accounted for 8% of generation, with most coming from small hydro. Capacity additions since 2010 have been dominated by hydro, oil and diesel. Among renewables, Colombia had 941MW of small hydro, only 130MW solar and a single 18MW wind plant. Colombia’s power market has numerous private and state-owned players across segments, but remains concentrated. Government-operated Empresas Publicas Medellín (EPM), together with privately owned Emgesa and Isagen, accounted for 65% of generation in 2019."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Colombia is highly dependent on hydroelectric energy, which has supplied on average 70% of generation annually since 2010. Prices are subject to upward pressure from extreme weather, as seen in 2015-16 when a pronounced El Nino effect was observed.  Serious delays in commissioning of the hydro megaproject Ituango, previously expected online in December 2018, combined with drought more recently produced a jump in electricity prices. Commercial electricity tariffs rose 40% over 2018-19, while residential tariffs climbed 30%. Colombia’s heavy reliance on large hydro has contributed to volatile wholesale power prices. From 2018 to 2019, wholesale prices spiked 76%."}]}
