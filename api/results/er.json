variety of barriers impact clean energy deployment in Eritrea. One of the key obstacles to project development is the general security and political situation, although there are signs that it is improving following the peace talks with Ethiopia. The lack of regulatory framework in the power sector does little to counteract the country’s overall lack of transparency. The import of renewable energy components and equipment in general is a cumbersome process. Given that clean energy is completely in its infancy in Eritrea, with no incentivizing policies nor a real renewable value chain in place, there is little to attract new projects."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Eritrea has so far attracted very little foreign investment. There is no framework for public-private partnerships, nor incentives to attract international interest. Following the historic peace summit with Ethiopia in July 2018, and the subsequent reopening of the border, relations between the two countries are gradually normalizing, which could create a more attractive business environment to investors. However, the only investments in clean energy to date are Aggreko’s 29.5MW diesel-solar hybrid project at the Nevsun mine, UNDP’s 0.825MW wind pilot in Assab, plus two solar mini-grids by Solarcentury (1.25MW) and E-Tech (2MW). Aside from Solarcentury’s announcement of a further 12MW of PV capacity, there are no other clean energy projects in the pipeline."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Eritrea is lacking in renewable energy policy implementation. The country aims for renewables to account for 70% of electricity generation by 2030, as part of its NDC, but does not yet have any enabling framework to help achieve this goal. As a further measure, it plans to improve power sector infrastructure to reduce transmission and distribution losses at least 50% also by 2030. However, there are a lack of incentives for renewable energy developers and very little transparency on existing regulations."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"The prerequisites for doing business in Eritrea are likely to improve following the political rapprochement with Ethiopia. The combination of low electrification rates, good solar and wind potential and the expense of fuel imports offers opportunities for mini-grid developers in particular. However, the poorly maintained or, in parts, non-existent transmission and distribution infrastructure impacts the viability of larger projects. The lack of transparent, clear regulatory framework and incentives further thwart clean energy project development."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"To date, the vast majority of installed capacity in Eritrea runs on imported fossil fuels. State-utility EEC dominates all segments of the power market and there is little transparency on the regulatory framework governing the energy sector in the country. A handful of independent power producers are active, with little transparency on their arrangements with EEC. Eritrea has no interconnection with its neighbors, although this could change in coming years, due to its improving relations with Ethiopia."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices are regulated in Eritrea and there is no differentiation between commercial, residential and industrial tariffs. Tariffs remain unchanged since 2017. Almost all on-grid capacity is powered by diesel, which is costly to import. Eritrea offers good conditions for clean energy deployment due to its strong wind and solar resources. Around half of the population still lacks access to power, so the potential for mini-grids is therefore high. The country’s levelized cost of energy for different technologies is difficult to determine due to the lack of detail on capacity additions."}]}
