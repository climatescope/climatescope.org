country’s highly decentralized institutions and fragmented governance structure have long hampered the liberalization of the national electricity sector. Within southeastern Europe, BiH is consistently ranked as the worst performer in reforming its power market. A lack of communication among government departments and licensing procedures involving multiple levels of governance complicate project development. Matters are worsened by the lack of awareness of renewable energy throughout the general population, reducing the political pressure to promote its deployment. Local opposition can also significantly delay renewable energy projects, especially small hydro. In addition, the three public utilities are self-sustaining, but their financial results have worsened in recent years due to poor hydraulic conditions and ageing thermal assets. Curtailment is not an issue given the low level of variable renewables deployment to date."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"The country’s first wind farm – the 50.6MW Mesihovina project – was commissioned in early 2018. The facility was built at a cost of $101.4 million. Siemens Gamesa provided the turbines and the project was primarily financed through a loan provided by KfW, a German state-owned development bank. Another wind farm, Podvelezje I, was financed in 2018. A July 2018 tender for the construction of a 65MW solar project was cancelled due to lack of bids. Most renewables investment has come from international concessional lenders, including International Finance Corp., the European Investment Bank and European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. In addition to domestic funds and government grants, organizations such as the United Nations Development Program, GIZ and USAID provide co-financing as well as technical assistance. Some small hydro projects are financed by local banks."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is split into two political entities – the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina (FBiH) and Republika Srpska. The two regions have separate governments and determine their energy policy independently. Each region has a separate feed-in tariff, with Republika Srpska additionally offering a feed-in premium. These schemes have only encouraged the build-out of smaller plants so far. In 2019, Republika Srpska removed wind from the technologies eligible for receiving a feed-in tariff or premium, causing policy uncertainty. State utilities have negotiated deals for larger wind farms directly with government. In Republika Srpska, self-generation is encouraged by offering a premium for the electricity produced. The country also has a target for renewable energy share in gross final energy consumption, set through the National Renewable Energy Action Plan that has been submitted to the European Commission. The country aims to reach 40% of renewable energy in total final consumption by 2020. FBiH is planning to introduce auctions in 2021."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Over half of the country’s thermal capacity was commissioned in the 1960s and 1970s – the list of thermal power plants to be closed encompasses 30% of the country’s total. However, there are several new coal plants in the pipeline. While power generation has increased in the past decade, domestic demand has remained more or less constant since the early 2000s. BiH is currently a net power exporter."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"BiH’s power fleet is roughly split between just over 2GW of lignite capacity and about 1.7GW of large hydro. Renewable energy capacity is minimal, but includes wind, solar, biomass and small hydro. While the electricity sector is open to private participation, the overwhelming share of generation and distribution is overseen by three vertically integrated public utilities whose remit is geographically distributed.
