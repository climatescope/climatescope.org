energy sector currently faces many issues, predominantly driven by perceptions about the country’s political and security risk.

In addition, a lack of expertise and weak public awareness about environmental issues have also not helped to propel the sector forward. As an incentivizing clean energy framework is currently not in place, more policy reforms will need to be implemented to attract large-scale project development."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Clean energy investment in Afghanistan has been very limited to date, with the most significant deal so far being a $330 million small hydro investment in 2014. Over the past decade, the sparse investment has originated almost exclusively from foreign investors that mainly target solar projects. The major funders behind these projects are international donors such as the Asian Development Bank or USAID."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Afghanistan’s renewable energy policy targets the development of 4.5GW-5GW of capacity by 2032. The policy is divided into two terms – Term 1 (2015-2020), which aims to create favorable environment for the growth of the renewables sector and Term 2 (2020-2032), which will actually achieve the capacity targets. There has been little progress on this target to date. The country has no auctions, feed-in tariffs or other incentivizing policies in place to promote renewables development. Net metering and import tax exemptions are nominally available, but there is little evidence about uptake."},{"id":"doing-business","name":"Doing business","value":"Power demand for Afghanistan is largely met by imports. Demand is expected to rise in future, yet imports are not a reliable source to meet the country’s electricity needs, mainly due to the political instability of the exporters. Despite nearly all segments of the population formally having access to power, supply is patchy and blackouts are common. There is strong potential for distributed power generation due to Afghanistan’s significant solar resources."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"Da Afghaninstan Breshna Sherkat (DABS) is a government-owned utility that controls all segments of the power market, with little participation from the private sector. Private sector participation is not unwelcome, however, and independent power producers can request to take part in the market. Due to this, there is no standard offtake procedure in place so far. On-site power generation to exclusively meet the demands of a specific site is permitted."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Afghanistan requires electricity imports to meet most of its power needs, making it highly reliant on neighboring countries.
