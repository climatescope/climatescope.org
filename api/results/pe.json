energy consumption has been stable, averaging a 1% increase in demand over the past two years. There are indications the country is oversupplied with power assets, which would be the main explanation for the hiatus in renewable auctions. Aside from accelerated depreciation, Peru offers no tax incentives for clean energy, charging 18% of import taxes for common renewable equipment such as wind turbines and PV panels, and it collects a value added tax averaging 16%."},{"id":"clean-energy-investment","name":"Clean energy investment","value":"Peru attracted $3.2 billion in clean energy investment from 2010 to 2019. Most went to small hydro and onshore wind projects, equivalent to 35% and 22%, respectively, of the total. However, from 2016 to 2019, solar attracted most investment, registering $252 million in the period, compared to $165 million in wind. Peru saw a peak in investment throughout 2012-2014, mostly led by financing of auction projects. In recent years, clean energy investment in the country has faded, dropping to $300 million in 2017 and less than $2 million in 2018. In 2019, Peru attracted only $51 million for wind projects. The country has received capital from international and national commercial financial institutions, as well as development banks. The biggest lead arrangers are U.S. Overseas Private Investment Corporation (OPIC) and European Investment Bank, registering $235 million and $213 million on PV and onshore wind."},{"id":"clean-energy-policy","name":"Clean energy policy","value":"Technology-specific auctions have been essential for renewables deployment in Peru. In 2008, under Decree No. 1002, the government established auctions to contract on-grid renewable capacity every two years. Since then, four auctions have been carried out, resulting in 71 project developments totaling 1.34GW of biomass, small hydro, solar and wind. Peru also offers priority dispatch to clean energy plants and 20% accelerated depreciation for renewables projects. Peru held an auction for off-grid solar in November 2014 to contract up to 500,000 off-grid PV systems. Ergon, the only winner, announced that will develop 150,000 to 200,000 systems by 2034, when the investment contract expires. As of July 2019, Ergon had commissioned almost 134,000 systems.

A renewable auction expected to be held in 2018 was canceled in April 2017, and no new tender has been announced. MINEM’s explanation for the cancellation is that not all projects selected in the previous auction are being developed. In 10 years, Peru saw its electrification rate spike from 74% to 97%, the biggest increase in Latin America. The progress is due to a rural electrification program, which included an off-grid auction aiming to contract PV systems for isolated regions in the country."},{"id":"power-market","name":"Power market","value":"In 2018, Peru generated 62% of its total 52TWh from renewable sources including large hydro. That source accounted for 57% in 2019, up from 40% in 2016, despite no significant capacity additions. Regarding non-renewable sources, coal and oil saw shrinkage in generation. Coal generated only 36GWh in 2019 compared to 674GWh in 2017; oil declined 92% in the same period. Peru’s installed hydro (small and large), solar, wind and biomass accounts for 45% of the country’s 13.2GW of generating capacity. In 2019, renewables installed capacity added accounted just for 167MW of hydro and 35MW of biomass, while wind and solar saw no increase."},{"id":"power-prices-and-lcoes","name":"Power prices and LCOEs","value":"Power prices in Peru have risen considerably over the past years.
