Fossil fuels still make up 60% of generating capacity and the country has a 37% electrification rate. Two tenders announced in September 2018 for 150 megawatts of solar and 200 megawatts of wind were canceled.

Prices are lower than many other East African countries, averaging close to $0.09 per kilowatt-hour in 2021. Prices are low partially due to the almost 600 megawatts of installed hydro capacity, but also because of heavy subsidies from Tanzania’s Ministry of Energy, which is intended to attract industrialization in the country. With more hydro capacity under development, prices will remain low. In February 2016, state-owned utility Tanzania Electric Supply Co.

The country added 100 megawatts of solar capacity in 2021. Despite promising tenders announced in 2018 for solar and wind, the only utility-scale project under construction to date is a small 2.4M-megawatt wind farm.","A number of independent power producers sell power to TANESCO under power purchase agreements, but TANESCO still owns more than half of the country’s generation.

There is a strong market for off-grid energy in Tanzania, and while the government continues its grid extension plans, in practice many households remain without access to energy in connected areas. In the mini-grid market, the government often changes the tariff that mini-grid developers are able to charge, making scalability difficult.","TANESCO is an unreliable offtaker. Many independent power producers operating in Tanzania have suffered from late payments from the utility, and there is little indication that TANESCO is working to amend this situation. In 2016, it lobbied for cheaper retail electricity to boost the country’s power demand, weakening its profitability.","Another challenge is the enforcement of a value-added tax exemption for off-grid solar products.
