In 2020, the quota was for 6 megawatts of biogas, 19.8 megawatts of wind, 7 megawatts of hydro, and 1.5 megawatts of wood fuel and other biomass. For 2021, the quotas are 10.47 megawatts for biogas, 35.5 megawatts for wind, 2.5 megawatts for solar photovoltaic (PV), and 0.9 megawatts for biomass.

Subsidized power tariffs could pose a further impediment to market access for IPPs.
