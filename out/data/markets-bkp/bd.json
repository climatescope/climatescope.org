This means rooftop solar is the sole option.","More recently, federal organizations like the Bangladesh Power Development Board have been conducting utility-scale auctions for renewable energy.","Investment flows in Bangladesh’s renewable energy sector have mostly been steered by the government through international development finance institutions, such as the Asian Development Bank, and the country’s central bank.

However, due to rising pressure to reduce dependence on dirty fossil fuels, it scrapped several coal projects in 2021.","The government is looking to scale up renewables-based power generation, mainly from solar and wind energy technologies.","Bangladesh has two types of rural electrification programs focused on extending the conventional grid to remote areas and installing solar irrigation pumps, solar mini-grids and improved cookstoves. In addition, the government-backed Infrastructure Development Company, a non-bank financial institution, also started a solar home system program in 2003 to supply electricity in areas where grid access is challenging.
