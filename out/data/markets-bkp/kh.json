This lays out the country’s plan to reach net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.","The pathway includes targets in the agriculture, forestry and land use, energy, transport, industrial and waste sectors. Together, these amount to a total emissions reduction of 156 million tons of CO2 equivalent (MtCO2e) in 2050 versus a business-as-usual scenario. The country is aiming for almost half of this emissions savings to come from reducing deforestation and expanding afforestation and reforestation activities.","Regarding energy, the strategy entails no new coal generation capacity installed beyond already committed projects, substituting coal in the industrial and power sector, switching to electricity for cooking, and investing in grid modernization, flexibility and storage. Cambodia is also aiming for 35% of its energy generation mix to come from renewables (including hydro) in 2050, of which 12% is expected to come from solar. However, this is not an ambitious target given that 49% of domestic generation in 2021 came from renewables.","The country’s transport goals are more challenging. They include public transport accounting for 30% of mobility in urban areas by 2050, and for electric vehicles to reach a 70% share for motorcycles and 40% for cars and urban buses. In addition, Cambodia is looking to increase the fuel efficiency of internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles."]},{"key":2,"title":"Nationally Determined Contributions (NDC)","text":["Cambodia submitted an updated Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) – a non-binding plan to achieve the goals set out in the Paris Agreement – to the UNFCCC in December 2020.

It has directed investment in the power sector towards large hydro, coal-fired power plants, transmission and distribution to support growing electricity demand and enable energy access to almost 98% of villages in 2021. Non-hydro renewables investment has been slower to take off.","The country has a limited number of clean energy policies in place today, and there are no incentives like feed-in tariffs or net metering to support residential or commercial solar. In fact, current rooftop solar regulations disincentivize residential and commercial investment."]},{"key":2,"title":"Power prices and costs","text":["Electricity Authority Cambodia (EAC), the state energy regulator, sets power retail prices nationwide. The average residential power price was $117.91 per megawatt-hour (MWh) in 2021, down 21% versus 2015.","Time-of-use tariffs are only available for medium- and high-voltage consumers who buy electricity from the national grid and do not have any grid-connected rooftop solar. The Ministry of Industry, Mines and Energy subsidizes electricity for certain types of consumers."]},{"key":3,"title":"Power market","text":["Cambodia’s power market is dominated by state-run utility Electricite du Cambodge (EDC). While almost all generation is owned by independent power producers, they can only sell their electricity via a special license to EDC, which has a monopoly over transmission in the country. Retail licenses are distributed by regulator EAC to EDC, as well as 469 small Rural Energy Enterprises (REE). This means each company enjoys a retail monopoly in the various fractions of different provinces.","Electricity tariffs in Cambodia are higher than neighboring countries Vietnam and Laos, although they dropped 22% between 2015 and 2020 (and have remained constant since) thanks to government efforts to make power more affordable. EDC and the government have therefore favored large power plants with low per-megawatt costs, such as hydro and coal, to support growing power demand. Energy imports also play an essential role in Cambodia’s power system.","Generation capacity has increased almost tenfold in the last 15 years, and in 2021 large hydro and coal-fired plants accounted for 85% of domestic power generation, Meanwhile, energy imports from neighboring countries met 30% of electricity demand.","The government’s ambitious electrification program has raised the share of households with access to electricity from 29% in 2012 to a reported 86% in 2021. However, the quality of electricity supply remains an issue in remote areas. The government aims for at least 70% of households in the country to be able to access grid-quality electricity by 2030. In remote areas of the country, electricity is supplied by hundreds of private operators that generate, deliver, and sell power."]},{"key":4,"title":"Doing business and barriers","text":["Since both EDC and the REEs hold retail licenses that grant them a monopoly in specific areas, private entities rely on them to enter the market. Distribution licensees, including operators of mini-grids that are connected to the main grid, are under pressure from thin distribution margins because both selling and buying tariffs are regulated. This threatens the economic sustainability of their businesses.","Regarding rooftop solar, regulations introduced in 2018 limit the capacity that can be connected to the grid for medium- and high-voltage customers to half the capacity contracted to EDC, and also forbid commercial and industrial customers from using the time-of-use rate. This deeply damages the business case. In addition, the lack of standards for connecting low-voltage customers has forced many these consumers to go off-grid. They face the choice of either discarding their investment in a rooftop solar system or acquiring an accompanying battery, which makes for a significantly higher upfront cost.","It is very difficult to finance rooftop solar and storage installations for residential or small commercial customers in Cambodia. This is due to high interest rates and the cost and time involved in checking that the investors meet the financial requirements."]}]},{"key":3,"title":"Transport","subsections":[{"key":1,"title":"EV market","text":["The electric vehicle (EV) market in Cambodia is in the extremely early stages.
