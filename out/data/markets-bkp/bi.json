The country has a specialized Rural Electrification Agency, which aims to plan and develop projects to electrify isolated areas. The only effective support for renewables developers in Burundi is import-tariff exemptions for solar and wind equipment established by the East African Community, of which Burundi is a member.

The power sector continues to be dominated by Regideso, which has a monopoly on electricity transmission, distribution, and supply.

Bureaucracy, poor infrastructure, trade barriers, high taxes and low access to credit are among the challenges for businesses. On the positive side, Burundi joined the East African Community in 2007 and started the implementation of a common external tariff in 2009. Burundi also embarked on major reforms to improve the procedure for creating a new business. The relationship with the East African Community could be a good opportunity for Burundi to participate in regional infrastructure projects, such as interconnection links and shared hydro power plants.","The country has faced difficulties attracting investment for energy infrastructure due to political instability and conflicts. The legal framework requires updating to attract private sector participation.
